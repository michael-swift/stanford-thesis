	abstract = {The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations. Here we show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.},

Recombinant viruses engineered to transmit across synapses provide a powerful approach for the dissection of neuronal circuitry in vivo. We recently demonstrated that recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus ({VSV}) can be endowed with anterograde or retrograde transsynaptic tracing ability by providing the virus with different glycoproteins. Here we extend the characterization of the transmission and gene expression of recombinant {VSV} ({rVSV}) with the rabies virus glycoprotein ({RABV}-G), and provide examples of its activity relative to the anterograde transsynaptic tracer form of {rVSV}. {rVSV} with {RABV}-G was found to drive strong expression of transgenes and to spread rapidly from neuron to neuron in only a retrograde manner. Depending upon how the {RABV}-G was delivered, {VSV} served as a polysynaptic or monosynaptic tracer, or was able to define projections through axonal uptake and retrograde transport. In animals co-infected with {rVSV} in its anterograde form, {rVSV} with {RABV}-G could be used to begin to characterize the similarities and differences in connections to different areas. {rVSV} with {RABV}-G provides a flexible, rapid, and versatile tracing tool that complements the previously described {VSV}-based anterograde transsynaptic tracer.},

	abstract = {The extent to which evolution is reversible has long fascinated biologists. Most previous work on the reversibility of morphological and life-history evolution has been indecisive, because of uncertainty and bias in the methods used to infer ancestral states for such characters. Further, despite theoretical work on the factors that could contribute to irreversibility, there is little empirical evidence on its causes, because sufficient understanding of the mechanistic basis for the evolution of new or ancestral phenotypes is seldom available. By studying the reversibility of evolutionary changes in protein structure and function, these limitations can be overcome. Here we show, using the evolution of hormone specificity in the vertebrate glucocorticoid receptor as a case-study, that the evolutionary path by which this protein acquired its new function soon became inaccessible to reverse exploration. Using ancestral gene reconstruction, protein engineering and X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate that five subsequent 'restrictive' mutations, which optimized the new specificity of the glucocorticoid receptor, also destabilized elements of the protein structure that were required to support the ancestral conformation. Unless these ratchet-like epistatic substitutions are restored to their ancestral states, reversing the key function-switching mutations yields a non-functional protein. Reversing the restrictive substitutions first, however, does nothing to enhance the ancestral function. Our findings indicate that even if selection for the ancestral function were imposed, direct reversal would be extremely unlikely, suggesting an important role for historical contingency in protein evolution.},

Here, we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1 protein interacts with dynamin and specific isoforms of endophilin to enhance receptor endocytosis. Arc/Arg3.1 selectively modulates trafficking of {AMPA}-type glutamate receptors ({AMPARs}) in neurons by accelerating endocytosis and reducing surface expression. The Arc/Arg3.1-endocytosis pathway appears to regulate basal {AMPAR} levels since Arc/Arg3.1 {KO} neurons exhibit markedly reduced endocytosis and increased steady-state surface levels.

Endosomes form contact sites with the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}) that are maintained during trafficking. Here, we show that stable contacts form between the {ER} and endosome at constricted sorting domains, and free diffusion of cargo is limited at these positions. We demonstrate that the site of constriction and fission for early and late endosomes is spatially and temporally linked to contact sites with the {ER}. Lastly, we show that altering {ER} structure and dynamics reduces the efficiency of endosome fission.

	abstract = {Multivesicular bodies ({MVBs}) are intracellular endosomal organelles characterized by multiple internal vesicles that are enclosed within a single outer membrane. {MVBs} were initially regarded as purely prelysosomal structures along the degradative endosomal pathway of internalized proteins. {MVBs} are now known to be involved in numerous endocytic and trafficking functions, including protein sorting, recycling, transport, storage, and release. This review of neuronal {MVBs} summarizes their research history, morphology, distribution, accumulation of cargo and constitutive proteins, transport, and theories of functions of {MVBs} in neurons and glia. Due to their complex morphologies, neurons have expanded trafficking and signaling needs, beyond those of "geometrically simpler" cells, but it is not known whether neuronal {MVBs} perform additional transport and signaling functions. This review examines the concept of compartment-specific {MVB} functions in endosomal protein trafficking and signaling within synapses, axons, dendrites and cell bodies. We critically evaluate reports of the accumulation of neuronal {MVBs} based on evidence of stress-induced {MVB} formation. Furthermore, we discuss potential functions of neuronal and glial {MVBs} in development, in dystrophic neuritic syndromes, injury, disease, and aging. {MVBs} may play a role in Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Niemann-Pick diseases, some types of frontotemporal dementia, prion and virus trafficking, as well as in adaptive responses of neurons to trauma and toxin or drug exposure. Functions of {MVBs} in neurons have been much neglected, and major gaps in knowledge currently exist. Developing truly {MVB}-specific markers would help to elucidate the roles of neuronal {MVBs} in intra- and intercellular signaling of normal and diseased neurons.

However, the molecular mechanisms mediating {AMPAR} exocytosis induced by {NMDAR} activation remain largely unknown. Here, we show that complexin, a protein that regulates neurotransmitter release via binding to {SNARE} complexes, is essential for {AMPAR} exocytosis during {LTP} but not for the constitutive {AMPAR} exocytosis that maintains basal synaptic strength. The regulated postsynaptic {AMPAR} exocytosis during {LTP} requires binding of complexin to {SNARE} complexes. In hippocampal neurons, presynaptic complexin acts together with synaptotagmin-1 to mediate neurotransmitter release. However, postsynaptic synaptotagmin-1 is not required for complexin-dependent {AMPAR} exocytosis during {LTP}. These results suggest a complexin-dependent molecular mechanism for regulating {AMPAR} delivery to synapses, a mechanism that is surprisingly similar to presynaptic exocytosis but controlled by regulators other than synaptotagmin-1.

While modeling the acute response to various anticancer agents in drug-sensitive human tumor cell lines, we consistently detected a small subpopulation of reversibly "drug-tolerant" cells. These cells demonstrate {\textbackslash}textgreater100-fold reduced drug sensitivity and maintain viability via engagement of {IGF}-1 receptor signaling and an altered chromatin state that requires the histone demethylase {RBP}2/{KDM}5A/Jarid1A. This drug-tolerant phenotype is transiently acquired and relinquished at low frequency by individual cells within the population, implicating the dynamic regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity in drug tolerance. The drug-tolerant subpopulation can be selectively ablated by treatment with {IGF}-1 receptor inhibitors or chromatin-modifying agents, potentially yielding a therapeutic opportunity. Together, these findings suggest that cancer cell populations employ a dynamic survival strategy in which individual cells transiently assume a reversibly drug-tolerant state to protect the population from eradication by potentially lethal exposures.

Subsequent to reorganization of the actin network, lytic granules polarize to the {IS} where their contents are secreted directly toward a target cell, providing critical access to host defense. There has been limited investigation into the relationship between the actin network and degranulation. Thus, we have evaluated the actin network and secretion using microscopy techniques that provide unprecedented resolution and/or functional insight. We show that the actin network extends throughout the {IS} and that degranulation occurs in areas where there is actin, albeit in sub-micron relatively hypodense regions. Therefore we propose that granules reach the plasma membrane in clearances in the network that are appropriately sized to minimally accommodate a granule and allow it to interact with the filaments. Our data support a model whereby lytic granules and the actin network are intimately associated during the secretion process and broadly suggest a mechanism for the secretion of large organelles in the context of a cortical actin barrier.},

We used this technique to monitor translation in budding yeast under both rich and starvation conditions.

We report crystal structures of Arc subdomains that form a bi-lobar architecture remarkably similar to the capsid domain of human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) gag protein. Analysis indicates Arc originated from the Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon family and was "domesticated" in higher vertebrates for synaptic functions. The Arc N-terminal lobe evolved a unique hydrophobic pocket that mediates intermolecular binding with synaptic proteins as resolved in complexes with {TARP}{\textbackslash}gamma2 (Stargazin) and {CaMKII} peptides and is essential for Arc's synaptic function. A consensus sequence for Arc binding identifies several additional partners that include genes implicated in schizophrenia. Arc N-lobe binding is inhibited by small chemicals suggesting Arc's synaptic action may be druggable. These studies reveal the remarkable evolutionary origin of Arc and provide a structural basis for understanding Arc's contribution to neural plasticity and disease.

Exosomes could be involved in intercellular communication and in the pathogenesis of infectious and degenerative diseases. The molecular mechanisms of exosome biogenesis and secretion are, however, poorly understood. Using an {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) screen, we identified five Rab {GTPases} that promote exosome secretion in {HeLa} cells. Among these, Rab27a and Rab27b were found to function in {MVE} docking at the plasma membrane. The size of {MVEs} was strongly increased by Rab27a silencing, whereas {MVEs} were redistributed towards the perinuclear region upon Rab27b silencing. Thus, the two Rab27 isoforms have different roles in the exosomal pathway. In addition, silencing two known Rab27 effectors, Slp4 (also known as {SYTL}4, synaptotagmin-like 4) and Slac2b (also known as {EXPH}5, exophilin 5), inhibited exosome secretion and phenocopied silencing of Rab27a and Rab27b, respectively. Our results therefore strengthen the link between {MVEs} and exosomes, and introduce ways of manipulating exosome secretion in vivo.},

Here we biochemically test approximately 700 wild strains of Saccharomyces for [{PSI}(+)] or [{MOT}3(+)], and find these prions in many. They conferred diverse phenotypes that were frequently beneficial under selective conditions. Simple meiotic re-assortment of the variation harboured within a strain readily fixed one such trait, making it robust and prion-independent. Finally, we genetically screened for unknown prion elements. Fully one-third of wild strains harboured them. These, too, created diverse, often beneficial phenotypes. Thus, prions broadly govern heritable traits in nature, in a manner that could profoundly expand adaptive opportunities.},

Here we demonstrate how to combine viral genetic barcoding with high-throughput sequencing to track single cells in a heterogeneous population. We use this technique to track the in vivo differentiation of unitary hematopoietic stem cells ({HSCs}). The results are consistent with single-cell transplantation studies but require two orders of magnitude fewer mice. In addition to its high throughput, the high sensitivity of the technique allows for a direct examination of the clonality of sparse cell populations such as {HSCs}. We show how these capabilities offer a clonal perspective of the {HSC} differentiation process. In particular, our data suggest that {HSCs} do not equally contribute to blood cells after irradiation-mediated transplantation, and that two distinct {HSC} differentiation patterns co-exist in the same recipient mouse after irradiation. This technique can be applied to any virus-accessible cell type for both in vitro and in vivo processes.},

With such data one might track heterogeneous cell sub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, {RNA} sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the {RNA} from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor ({LIF}) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single-cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships. {VIDEO} {ABSTRACT}.

The common assumption is that these effects are mediated through regulation of heat-shock protein ({HSP}) expression. However, the transcriptional network that {HSF}1 coordinates directly in malignancy and its relationship to the heat-shock response have never been defined. By comparing cells with high and low malignant potential alongside their nontransformed counterparts, we identify an {HSF}1-regulated transcriptional program specific to highly malignant cells and distinct from heat shock. Cancer-specific genes in this program support oncogenic processes: cell-cycle regulation, signaling, metabolism, adhesion and translation. {HSP} genes are integral to this program, however, many are uniquely regulated in malignancy. This {HSF}1 cancer program is active in breast, colon and lung tumors isolated directly from human patients and is strongly associated with metastasis and death.

We propose, and demonstrate using a molecular-level evolutionary simulation, that selection against toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create all of the observed covariation.

We discovered abundant (12 to 24\%) monoallelic expression of autosomal genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation of the paternal X chromosome.

The mode of activation altered the relationship with division, as {CD}40 ligand increased switching to {IgA} and decreased switching to {IgG}2b and {IgG}3 when measured per division. This division-linked switching behavior could be described by Gaussian probability distributions centered around a mean division number. The divisions at which switching to {IgG}3 and {IgG}2b occurred overlapped, raising the possibility that the two switching mechanisms were linked. However, when {IgG}3+ and {IgG}3- B cells were sorted and placed back in culture, they switched to {IgG}2b at an equivalent rate, indicating that alternative switching decisions were made independently within a single cell. As a consequence, isotype switching could be predicted at the population level by standard probability laws. Therefore, division number provides a framework for a stochastic description of differentiation that may be widely applicable.},

It occurs by a unique type of intrachromosomal deletional recombination within special G-rich tandem repeated {DNA} sequences [called switch, or S, regions located upstream of each of the heavy chain constant (C(H)) region genes, except Cdelta]. The recombination is initiated by the B cell-specific activation-induced cytidine deaminase ({AID}), which deaminates cytosines in both the donor and acceptor S regions. {AID} activity converts several {dC} bases to {dU} bases in each S region, and the {dU} bases are then excised by the uracil {DNA} glycosylase {UNG}; the resulting abasic sites are nicked by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease ({APE}). {AID} attacks both strands of transcriptionally active S regions, but how transcription promotes {AID} targeting is not entirely clear. Mismatch repair proteins are then involved in converting the resulting single-strand {DNA} breaks to double-strand breaks with {DNA} ends appropriate for end-joining recombination.

	abstract = {The B-cell receptor ({BCR}) controls B-cell activation by biochemical signaling and by physical acquisition of antigens from immune synapses with antigen-presenting cells. B cells grab and gather antigens by engaging conserved biomechanical modules for cell spreading, receptor clustering, receptor transport, and generation of pulling forces, which culminate in antigen extraction and endocytosis. The mechanical activity in B-cell synapses follows a pattern of positive and negative feedbacks that regulate the amount of extracted antigen by directly manipulating the dynamics of {BCR}-antigen bonds. In particular, spreading and clustering increase the association of {BCR} with antigen, providing amplification and sensitivity, while pulling forces dissociate the {BCR} from the antigen, testing the quality of antigen binding. The emergent effect of mechanical forces in B-cell synapses is ligand discrimination that can be scaled across a range of {BCR} affinities, provided that the magnitude and timing of the mechanical forces are precisely coordinated with biochemical readouts from the {BCR}. Such coordination predicts not only novel connections between {BCR} signaling, endocytosis, and the actomyosin cytoskeleton but also mechanosensitivity of these pathways. The mechanical control of bond formation and separation may be generally beneficial in signaling networks with variable thresholds. {\textbackslash}copyright 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Polyribosomal complexes beneath postsynaptic sites on dendrites provide a substrate for local translation of particular {mRNAs}, but the signals that target {mRNAs} to synapses remain to be defined. Here, we report that high frequency activation of the perforant path projections to the dentate gyrus causes newly synthesized {mRNA} for the immediate-early gene ({IEG}) Arc to localize selectively in activated dendritic segments. Newly synthesized Arc protein also accumulates in the portion of the dendrite that had been synaptically activated. The targeting of Arc {mRNA} was not disrupted by locally inhibiting protein synthesis, indicating that the signals for {mRNA} localization reside in the {mRNA} itself. This novel mechanism through which newly synthesized {mRNA} is precisely targeted to activated synapses is well suited to play a role in the enduring forms of activity-dependent synaptic modification that require protein synthesis.},

	abstract = {Genetically encoded sensors of neural activity enable visualization of circuit-level function in the central nervous system. Although our understanding of the molecular events that regulate neuronal firing, synaptic function, and plasticity has expanded rapidly over the past 15 years, an appreciation for how cellular changes are functionally integrated at the circuit level has lagged. A new generation of tools that employ fluorescent sensors of neural activity promises unique opportunities to bridge the gap between cellular level and system level analysis. This review will focus on genetically encoded sensors. A primary advantage of these indicators is that they can be nonselectively introduced to large populations of cells using either transgenic-mediated or viral-mediated approaches. This ability removes the nontrivial obstacles of how to get chemical indicators into cells of interest, a problem that has dogged investigators who have been interested in mapping neural function in the intact {CNS}. Five different types of approaches and their relative utility will be reviewed here: first, reporters of immediate-early gene ({IEG}) activation using promoters such as c-fos and arc; second, voltage-based sensors, such as {GFP}-coupled Na+ and K+ channels; third, Cl*-based sensors; fourth, Ca2+-based sensors, such as Camgaroo and the troponin-based {TN}-L15; and fifth, {pH}-based sensors, which have been particularly useful for examining synaptic activity of highly convergent afferents in sensory systems in vivo. Particular attention will be paid to reporters of {IEG} expression, because these tools employ the built-in threshold function that occurs with activation of gene expression, provoking new experimental questions by expanding the timescale of analysis for circuit-level and system-level functional mapping.},

Class switching occurs by a deletional recombination between two switch regions, each of which is associated with a H chain constant region gene. Class switch recombination ({CSR}) is instigated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which converts cytosines in switch regions to uracils. The uracils are subsequently removed by two {DNA}-repair pathways, resulting in mutations, single-strand {DNA} breaks, and the double-strand breaks required for {CSR}. We discuss several aspects of {CSR}, including how {CSR} is induced, {CSR} in B cell progenitors, the roles of transcription and chromosomal looping in {CSR}, and the roles of certain {DNA}-repair enzymes in {CSR}.

This analysis revealed a high similarity of {IgM}(+)({IgD}(+)){CD}27(+) and {IgG}(+) memory B cells but also pointed at distinct functional capacities of both subsets. In vitro analyses revealed a tendency of activated {IgM}(+){IgD}(+){CD}27(+) B cells to migrate to B-cell follicles and undergo germinal center ({GC}) B-cell differentiation, whereas activated {IgG}(+) memory B cells preferentially showed a plasma cell ({PC}) fate. This observation was supported by reverse regulation of B-cell lymphoma 6 and {PR} domain containing 1 and differential {BTB} and {CNC} homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 2 expression. Moreover, {IgM}(+){IgD}(+){CD}27(+) B lymphocytes preferentially responded to neutrophil-derived cytokines. Costimulation with catecholamines, carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 8 ({CEACAM}8), and {IFN}-{\textbackslash}gamma caused differentiation of {IgM}(+){IgD}(+){CD}27(+) B cells into {PCs}, induced class switching to {IgG}2, and was reproducible in cocultures with neutrophils. In conclusion, this study substantiates memory B-cell characteristics of human {IgM}(+){IgD}(+){CD}27(+) B cells in that they share typical memory B-cell transcription patterns with {IgG}(+) post-{GC} B cells and show a faster and more vigorous restimulation potential, a hallmark of immune memory. Moreover, this work reveals a functional plasticity of human {IgM} memory B cells by showing their propensity to undergo secondary {GC} reactions upon reactivation, but also by their special role in early inflammation via interaction with immunomodulatory neutrophils.},

Exosomal release is a way of secreting membrane proteins meant to be discarded, or to be passed on to other cells.

We find that exosomes released by cortical neurones contain the L1 cell adhesion molecule, the {GPI}-anchored prion protein, and the {GluR}2/3 but not the {NR}1 subunits of glutamate receptors. We also show that exosomal release is regulated by depolarisation.

However, the duration of humoral immunity and the role played by memory B cells remain poorly defined. {METHODS}: We performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody titers specific for viral antigens (vaccinia, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus) and nonreplicating antigens (tetanus and diphtheria) in 45 subjects for a period of up to 26 years. In addition, we measured antigen-specific memory B cells by means of limiting-dilution analysis, and we compared memory B-cell frequencies to their corresponding serum antibody levels. {RESULTS}: Antiviral antibody responses were remarkably stable, with half-lives ranging from an estimated 50 years for varicella-zoster virus to more than 200 years for other viruses such as measles and mumps. Antibody responses against tetanus and diphtheria antigens waned more quickly, with estimated half-lives of 11 years and 19 years, respectively. B-cell memory was long-lived, but there was no significant correlation between peripheral memory B-cell numbers and antibody levels for five of the eight antigens tested. {CONCLUSIONS}: These studies provide quantitative analysis of serologic memory for multiple antigens in subjects followed longitudinally over the course of more than one decade. In cases in which multiple exposures or repeated vaccinations were common, memory B-cell numbers did not correlate with antibody titers. This finding suggests that peripheral memory B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells may represent independently regulated cell populations and may play different roles in the maintenance of protective immunity.

Accordingly, memory B cells exhibited enhanced survival, proliferation, and Ig secretion, and they entered division more rapidly than did naive B cells in response to both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent stimuli. Furthermore, both {IgM} and isotype-switched memory B cells, but not naive B cells, costimulated {CD}4+ T cells in vitro through a mechanism dependent on their constitutive expression of {CD}80 and {CD}86.

The mechanism underlying this difference in responsiveness of naive vs memory B cells remains unclear. We have quantitated the response of naive and memory human B cells after in vitro stimulation with T cell-derived stimuli. In response to stimulation with {CD}40 ligand alone or with {IL}-10, both {IgM}-expressing and Ig isotype-switched memory B cells entered their first division 20-30 h earlier than did naive B cells. In contrast, the time spent traversing subsequent divisions was similar. Consistent with previous studies, only memory cells differentiated to {CD}38(+) blasts in a manner that increased with consecutive division number. These differentiated {CD}38(+) B cells divided faster than did {CD}38(-) memory B cell blasts. Proliferation of {CD}40 ligand-stimulated naive B cells as well as both {CD}38(+) and {CD}38(-) cells present in cultures of memory B cells was increased by {IL}-10. In contrast, {IL}-2 enhanced proliferation of {CD}38(-) and {CD}38(+) memory B cell blasts, but not naive cells. Thus, memory B cells possess an intrinsic advantage over naive B cells in both the time to initiate a response and in the division-based rate of effector cell development. These differences help explain the accelerated Ab response exhibited by memory B cells after secondary challenge by an invading pathogen, a hallmark of immunological memory.},

Switching to {IgG} was induced by {IL}-4 and, to a lesser extent, {IL}-13 and {IL}-10. The combination of {IL}-10 with {IL}-4, but not {IL}-13, induced a higher percentage of cells to undergo switching. Isotype switching to {IgG} by human {CD}40L-activated naive B cells was found to be linked to the division history of the cells: {IgG}(+) cells appeared in cultures of B cells stimulated with {CD}40L and {IL}-4 after approximately the third cell division, with the majority expressing {IgG}1, thus revealing a predictable pattern of {IgG} isotype switching. These results reveal a useful quantitative framework for monitoring the effects of cytokines on proliferation and isotype switching that should prove valuable for screening Ig immunodeficiencies and polymorphisms in the population for a better understanding of the regulation of human humoral immune responses.},

Here, we develop such a framework, illustrating its utility by analyzing data from barcoded multipotent cells of the blood system. This application demonstrates that the data require additional paths beyond those found in the classical model, which leads us to propose that hematopoietic differentiation follows a loss of potential mechanism and to suggest further experiments to test this deduction.

We performed an {shRNA} screen to identify factors required for class switch recombination ({CSR}) of antibody loci. We found that Spt5, a factor associated with stalled {RNA} polymerase {II} (Pol {II}) and single stranded {DNA} ({ssDNA}), is required for {CSR}.

	abstract = {The isotype specificity of immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching is regulated by a cytokine which induces transcription of a specific switch (S) region, giving rise to so-called germline transcripts. Although previous studies have demonstrated that germline transcription of an S region is required for class switch recombination ({CSR}) of that particular S region, it has not been shown whether the level of S region transcription affects the efficiency of {CSR}. We addressed this question by using an artificial {DNA} construct containing a constitutively transcribed mu switch (Smu) region and an alpha switch (Salpha) region driven by a tetracycline-responsive promoter. The construct was introduced into a switch-inducible B lymphoma line and the quantitative correlation between Salpha region transcription and class switching efficiency was evaluated. The level of Salpha transcription was linearly correlated with {CSR} efficiency, reaching a plateau at saturation. On the other hand, we failed to obtain the evidence to support involvement of either {RNA}-{DNA} heteroduplex or trans germline transcripts in {CSR}. Taken together, it is likely that S region transcription and/or transcript processing in situ may be required for {CSR}. We propose that because of the unusual properties of S region {DNA}, transcription induces the {DNA} to transiently be single stranded, permitting secondary structure(s) to form. Such structures may be recognition targets of a putative class switch recombinase.},

Previously, we identified a 210-{kDa} germinal center-associated nuclear protein ({GANP}) that is up-regulated selectively in germinal centers and carries an {MCM}-binding domain in the carboxyl-terminal side. In addition, here, we found a region (from 414 to 550 aa) in {GANP} molecule that is slightly similar to the known {DNA}-primase component p49. The recombinant {GANP} fragment covering this region synthesizes {RNA} primers for extension by {DNA} polymerase I with single-stranded {DNA} templates in vitro. {GANP} {DNA}-primase activity is controlled by phosphorylation at Ser(502) that is induced by {CD}40-mediated signaling in vitro and in the germinal center B cells stimulated with antigen in vivo. Overexpression of ganp {cDNA} in Daudi B cells caused the increased {DNA} synthesis more than the levels of the mock-transfectants. These evidences suggested that the novel {DNA}-primase {GANP} is involved in regulation of cell proliferation of antigen-driven B cells in germinal centers.},

Moreover, a very small population ({\textbackslash}textless 1\% of {PB} B cells) of highly mutated {IgD}-only B cells was detected, which likely represent the {PB} counterpart of {IgD}-only tonsillar germinal center and plasma cells. Overall, the B cell pool in the {PB} of adults consists of approximately 40\% mutated memory B cells and 60\% unmutated, naive {IgD}+{CD}27(-) B cells (including {CD}5(+) B cells). In the somatically mutated B cells, {VH} region genes carry a two- to threefold higher load of somatic mutation than rearranged Vkappa genes. This might be due to an intrinsically lower mutation rate in kappa light chain genes compared with heavy chain genes and/or result from kappa light chain gene rearrangements in {GC} B cells. A common feature of the somatically mutated B cell subsets is the expression of the {CD}27 cell surface antigen which therefore may represent a general marker for memory B cells in humans.},

	abstract = {Antibody class switching is mediated by somatic recombination between switch regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus. Targeting of recombination to particular switch regions is strictly regulated by cytokines through the induction of switch transcripts starting 5' of the repetitive switch regions. However, switch transcription as such is not sufficient to target switch recombination. This has been shown in mutant mice, in which the I-exon and its promoter upstream of the switch region were replaced with heterologous promoters. Here we show that, in the murine germline targeted replacement of the endogenous gamma1 promoter, I-exon, and I-exon splice donor site by heterologous promoter and splice donor sites directs switch recombination in activated B lymphocytes constitutively to the gamma1 switch region. In contrast, switch recombination to {IgG}1 is inhibited in mutant mice, in which the replacement does not include the heterologous splice donor site. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that targeting of switch recombination to {IgG}1 in vivo requires processing of the Igamma1 switch transcripts. Either the processing machinery or the processed transcripts are involved in class switch recombination.},

This pattern results from cell-intrinsic processes following activation and the influence of external regulation. Here we apply quantitative methods to study B-cell responses in vitro. Our results reveal that B cells stimulated through two Toll-like receptors ({TLRs}) require minimal external direction to undergo the basic pattern typical of immunity. Altering the stimulus strength regulates the outcome in a quantal manner by varying the number of cells that participate in the response. In contrast, the T-cell-dependent {CD}40 activation signal induces a response where division times and differentiation rates vary in relation to stimulus strength. These studies offer insight into how the adaptive antibody response may have evolved from simple autonomous response patterns to the highly regulable state that is now observed in mammals.},

Recognizing that successful early experiences can inform subsequent efforts, the National Human Genome Research Institute brought together a number of these groups to describe their ongoing projects and challenges, identify common infrastructure and research needs, and outline an implementation framework for investigating and introducing similar programs elsewhere. Chief among the challenges were limited evidence and consensus on which genomic variants were medically relevant; lack of reimbursement for genomically driven interventions; and burden to patients and clinicians of assaying, reporting, intervening, and following up genomic findings. Key infrastructure needs included an openly accessible knowledge base capturing sequence variants and their phenotypic associations and a framework for defining and cataloging clinically actionable variants. Multiple institutions are actively engaged in using genomic information in clinical care.

	abstract = {The nervous system is complex not simply because of the enormous number of neurons it contains but by virtue of the specificity with which they are connected. Unraveling this specificity is the task of neuroanatomy. In this endeavor, neuroanatomists have traditionally exploited an impressive array of tools ranging from the Golgi method to electron microscopy. An ideal method for studying anatomy would label neurons that are interconnected, and, in addition, allow expression of foreign genes in these neurons. Fortuitously, nature has already partially developed such a method in the form of neurotropic viruses, which have evolved to deliver their genetic material between synaptically connected neurons while largely eluding glia and the immune system. While these characteristics make some of these viruses a threat to human health, simple modifications allow them to be used in controlled experimental settings, thus enabling neuroanatomists to trace multi-synaptic connections within and across brain regions. Wild-type neurotropic viruses, such as rabies and alpha-herpes virus, have already contributed greatly to our understanding of brain connectivity, and modern molecular techniques have enabled the construction of recombinant forms of these and other viruses. These newly engineered reagents are particularly useful, as they can target genetically defined populations of neurons, spread only one synapse to either inputs or outputs, and carry instructions by which the targeted neurons can be made to express exogenous proteins, such as calcium sensors or light-sensitive ion channels, that can be used to study neuronal function. In this review, we address these uniquely powerful features of the viruses already in the neuroanatomist's toolbox, as well as the aspects of their biology that currently limit their utility. Based on the latter, we consider strategies for improving viral tracing methods by reducing toxicity, improving control of transsynaptic spread, and extending the range of species that can be studied.},

Each variable domain can be split into 3 regions of sequence variability termed the complementarity-determining regions ({CDRs}) and 4 regions of relatively constant sequence termed the framework regions. The 3 {CDRs} of the heavy chain are paired with the 3 {CDRs} of the light chain to form the antigen-binding site, as classically defined. The constant domains of the heavy chain can be switched to allow altered effector function while maintaining antigen specificity. There are 5 main classes of heavy chain constant domains.

Memory B cells are immortalized with high efficiency using Epstein-Barr virus ({EBV}) in the presence of a toll-like receptor ({TLR}) agonist, while plasma cells are maintained in single-cell cultures by using interleukin 6 ({IL}-6) or stromal cells. In both cases, multiple parallel assays, including functional assays, can be used to identify rare cells that produce antibodies with unique properties. Using these methods, we have isolated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies against a variety of viruses, in particular, a pan-influenza-A-neutralizing antibody and an antibody that neutralizes four different paramyxoviruses. Given the high throughput and the possibility of directly screening for function (rather than just binding), these methods are instrumental to implement a target-agnostic approach to identify the most effective antibodies and, consequently, the most promising targets for vaccine design. This approach is exemplified by the identification of unusually potent cytomegalovirus-neutralizing antibodies that led to the identification of the target, a pentameric complex that we are developing as a candidate vaccine.},

We previously showed that loss-of-function mutations in {STAT}3, but not {STAT}1, abrogate {IL}-10- and {IL}-21-mediated differentiation of human naive B cells into plasmablasts. We report here that, in contrast to naive B cells, {STAT}3-deficient memory B cells responded to these {STAT}3-activating cytokines, differentiating into plasmablasts and secreting high levels of {IgM}, {IgG}, and {IgA}, as well as Ag-specific {IgG}. This was associated with the induction of the molecular machinery necessary for {PC} formation. Mutations in {IL}21R, however, abolished {IL}-21-induced responses of both naive and memory human B cells and compromised memory B cell formation in vivo. These findings reveal a key role for {IL}-21R/{STAT}3 signaling in regulating human B cell function. Furthermore, our results indicate that the threshold of {STAT}3 activation required for differentiation is lower in memory compared with naive B cells, thereby identifying an intrinsic difference in the mechanism underlying differentiation of naive versus memory B cells.},

As the lungs adapt to environmental challenges, so too do alveolar macrophages adapt to accommodate the ever-changing needs of the tissue. In this Review, we discuss the unique characteristics of alveolar macrophages, the mechanisms that drive their adaptation and the direct and indirect influences of epithelial cells on them. We also highlight how airway luminal macrophages function as sentinels of a healthy state and how they do not respond in a pro-inflammatory manner to antigens that do not disrupt lung structure. The unique tissue location and function of alveolar macrophages distinguish them from other macrophage populations and suggest that it is important to classify macrophages according to the site that they occupy.},

We mapped the formation of lung neuroepithelial bodies ({NEBs}), innervated clusters of neuroendocrine/neurosensory cells within the bronchial epithelium, revealing a targeted mode of cell migration that we named "slithering," in which cells transiently lose epithelial character but remain associated with the membrane while traversing neighboring epithelial cells to reach cluster sites. Immunostaining, lineage tracing, clonal analysis, and live imaging showed that {NEB} progenitors, initially distributed randomly, downregulate adhesion and polarity proteins, crawling over and between neighboring cells to converge at diametrically opposed positions at bronchial branchpoints, where they reestablish epithelial structure and express neuroendocrine genes. There is little accompanying progenitor proliferation or apoptosis. Activation of the slithering program may explain why lung cancers arising from neuroendocrine cells are highly metastatic.

Clonal cell lines reflect an independent choice to express the maternal, the paternal, or both alleles for each of these genes.

	abstract = {Retroviral replication proceeds through an obligate integrated {DNA} provirus, making retroviral vectors attractive vehicles for human gene-therapy. Though most of the host cell genome is available for integration, the process of integration site selection is not random. Retroviruses differ in their choice of chromatin-associated features and also prefer particular nucleotide sequences at the point of insertion. Lentiviruses including {HIV}-1 preferentially integrate within the bodies of active genes, whereas the prototypical gammaretrovirus Moloney murine leukemia virus ({MoMLV}) favors strong enhancers and active gene promoter regions. Integration is catalyzed by the viral integrase protein, and recent research has demonstrated that {HIV}-1 and {MoMLV} targeting preferences are in large part guided by integrase-interacting host factors ({LEDGF}/p75 for {HIV}-1 and {BET} proteins for {MoMLV}) that tether viral intasomes to chromatin. In each case, the selectivity of epigenetic marks on histones recognized by the protein tether helps to determine the integration distribution. In contrast, nucleotide preferences at integration sites seem to be governed by the ability for the integrase protein to locally bend the {DNA} duplex for pairwise insertion of the viral {DNA} ends. We discuss approaches to alter integration site selection that could potentially improve the safety of retroviral vectors in the clinic. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2014.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: B cells expressing {IgE} contribute to immunity against parasites and venoms and are the source of antigen specificity in allergic patients, yet the developmental pathways producing these B cells in human subjects remain a subject of debate. Much of our knowledge of {IgE} lineage development derives from model studies in mice rather than from human subjects. {OBJECTIVE}: We evaluate models for isotype switching to {IgE} in human subjects using immunoglobulin heavy chain ({IGH}) mutational lineage data. {METHODS}: We analyzed {IGH} repertoires in 9 allergic and 24 healthy adults using high-throughput {DNA} sequencing of 15,843,270 {IGH} rearrangements to identify clonal lineages of B cells containing members expressing {IgE}. Somatic mutations in {IGH} inherited from common ancestors within the clonal lineage are used to infer the relationships between B cells. {RESULTS}: Data from 613,641 multi-isotype B-cell clonal lineages, of which 592 include an {IgE} member, are consistent with indirect switching to {IgE} from {IgG}- or {IgA}-expressing lineage members in human subjects. We also find that these inferred isotype switching frequencies are similar in healthy and allergic subjects. {CONCLUSIONS}: We found evidence that secondary isotype switching of mutated {IgG}1-expressing B cells is the primary source of {IgE} in human subjects, with lesser contributions from precursors expressing other switched isotypes and rarely {IgM} or {IgD}, suggesting that {IgE} is derived from previously antigen-experienced B cells rather than naive B cells that typically express low-affinity unmutated antibodies. These data provide a basis from which to evaluate allergen-specific human antibody repertoires in healthy and diseased subjects.

Two non-consecutive hydrophobic structures termed "spines" anchor all the elements important for catalysis to the F-helix. They make firm, but flexible, connections within the molecule, providing a high level of internal dynamics of the protein kinase. During the course of evolution, protein kinases developed a universal regulatory mechanism associated with a large activation segment that can be dynamically folded and unfolded in the course of cell functioning.

Growing evidence points to the delicacy of this host-microbe interplay and how disruptive interventions could have lifelong consequences. The goal of this article was to provide insights into the potential role of the gut microbiota in coordinating the immune-neuroendocrine cross-talk. {METHODS}: Literature from a range of sources, including {PubMed}, Google Scholar, and {MEDLINE}, was searched to identify recent reports regarding the impact of the gut microbiota on the host immune and neuroendocrine systems in health and disease. {FINDINGS}: The immune system and nervous system are in continuous communication to maintain a state of homeostasis. Significant gaps in knowledge remain regarding the effect of the gut microbiota in coordinating the immune-nervous systems dialogue. Recent evidence from experimental animal models found that stimulation of subsets of immune cells by the gut microbiota, and the subsequent cross-talk between the immune cells and enteric neurons, may have a major impact on the host in health and disease. {IMPLICATIONS}: Data from rodent models, as well as from a few human studies, suggest that the gut microbiota may have a major role in coordinating the communication between the immune and neuroendocrine systems to develop and maintain homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The challenge now is to fully decipher the molecular mechanisms that link the gut microbiota, the immune system, and the neuroendocrine system in a network of communication to eventually translate these findings to the human situation, both in health and disease.

We test the method with extensive simulated data, and demonstrate that in some scenarios the method provides higher power than previously reported approaches to detect selective sweeps, and can provide surprisingly good localization of the position of a selected allele. A strength of our technique is that it uses allele frequency differentiation between populations, which is much more robust to ascertainment bias in {SNP} discovery than methods based on the allele frequency spectrum. We apply this method to compare continentally diverse populations, as well as Northern and Southern Europeans.

We observed exocytosis in both the dendrite and spine under basal conditions. The rate of {AMPA} receptor exocytosis increased approximately 5-fold during {LTP} induction and decayed to the basal level within approximately 1 min, both in the stimulated spine and in the dendrite within approximately 3 microm of the stimulated spine. {AMPA} receptors inserted in the spine were trapped in the spine in an activity-dependent manner. The activity-dependent exocytosis required the Ras-{ERK} pathway, but not {CaMKII}.

In mice, six additional sets of constant region exons ({CHs}) lie 100-200 kilobases downstream in the same transcriptional orientation as V(D)J and Cμ exons. Long repetitive switch (S) regions precede Cμ and downstream {CHs}. In mature B cells, class switch recombination ({CSR}) generates different antibody classes by replacing Cμ with a downstream {CH} (ref. 2). Activation-induced cytidine deaminase ({AID}) initiates {CSR} by promoting deamination lesions within Sμ and a downstream acceptor S region; these lesions are converted into {DNA} double-strand breaks ({DSBs}) by general {DNA} repair factors. Productive {CSR} must occur in a deletional orientation by joining the upstream end of an Sμ {DSB} to the downstream end of an acceptor S-region {DSB}.

Thus, whether orientation-specific joining is a programmed mechanistic feature of {CSR} as it is for V(D)J recombination and, if so, how this is achieved is unknown. To address this question, we adapt high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing into a highly sensitive {DSB} end-joining assay and apply it to endogenous {AID}-initiated S-region {DSBs} in mouse B cells. We show that {CSR} is programmed to occur in a productive deletional orientation and does so via an unprecedented mechanism that involves in cis Igh organizational features in combination with frequent S-region {DSBs} initiated by {AID}. We further implicate {ATM}-dependent {DSB}-response factors in enforcing this mechanism and provide an explanation of why {CSR} is so reliant on the 53BP1 {DSB}-response factor.},

The high germline and somatic diversity of the Ig repertoire presents challenges for biologically meaningful analysis, which requires specialized computational methods. We have developed a suite of utilities, Change-O, which provides tools for advanced analyses of large-scale Ig repertoire sequencing data. Change-O includes tools for determining the complete set of Ig variable region gene segment alleles carried by an individual (including novel alleles), partitioning of Ig sequences into clonal populations, creating lineage trees, inferring somatic hypermutation targeting models, measuring repertoire diversity, quantifying selection pressure, and calculating sequence chemical properties. All Change-O tools utilize a common data format, which enables the seamless integration of multiple analyses into a single workflow. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Change-O is freely available for non-commercial use and may be downloaded from http://clip.med.yale.edu/changeo. {CONTACT}: steven.kleinstein@yale.edu. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author 2015.

Analysis of {IG} sequences typically requires identification of each gene, as well as a comparison of sequence variations in the context of defined regions. General purpose tools, such as the {BLAST} program, have only limited use for such tasks, as the rearranged nature of an {IG} sequence and the variable length of each gene requires multiple rounds of {BLAST} searches for a single {IG} sequence. Additionally, manual assembly of different genes is difficult and error-prone. To address these issues and to facilitate other common tasks in analysing {IG} sequences, we have developed the sequence analysis tool {IgBLAST} (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/). With this tool, users can view the matches to the germline V, D and J genes, details at rearrangement junctions, the delineation of {IG} V domain framework regions and complementarity determining regions. {IgBLAST} has the capability to analyse nucleotide and protein sequences and can process sequences in batches. Furthermore, {IgBLAST} allows searches against the germline gene databases and other sequence databases simultaneously to minimize the chance of missing possibly the best matching germline V gene.},

The agent shows heterogeneity with respect to size, apparently a result of its hydrophobicity; the smallest form may have a molecular weight of 50,000 or less. Because the novel properties of the scrapie agent distinguish it from viruses, plasmids, and viroids, a new term "prion" is proposed to denote a small proteinaceous infectious particle which is resistant to inactivation by most procedures that modify nucleic acids.

We and others have previously shown that superpositively charged proteins are efficiently endocytosed and can bring associated proteins and nucleic acids into cells. The vast majority of cargo delivered in this manner, however, remains in endosomes and does not reach the cytosol. In this study we designed and implemented a screen to discover peptides that enhance the endosomal escape of proteins fused to superpositively charged {GFP} (+36 {GFP}). From a screen of peptides previously reported to disrupt microbial membranes without known mammalian cell toxicity, we discovered a 13-residue peptide, aurein 1.2, that substantially increases cytosolic protein delivery by up to ∼5-fold in a cytosolic fractionation assay in cultured cells. Four additional independent assays for nonendosomal protein delivery collectively suggest that aurein 1.2 enhances endosomal escape of associated endocytosed protein cargo. Structure-function studies clarified peptide sequence and protein conjugation requirements for endosomal escape activity. When applied to the in vivo delivery of +36 {GFP}-Cre recombinase fusions into the inner ear of live mice, fusion with aurein 1.2 dramatically increased nonendosomal Cre recombinase delivery potency, resulting in up to 100\% recombined inner hair cells and 96\% recombined outer hair cells, compared to 0-4\% recombined hair cells from +36-{GFP}-Cre without aurein 1.2. Collectively, these findings describe a genetically encodable, endosome escape-enhancing peptide that can substantially increase the cytoplasmic delivery of cationic proteins in vitro and in vivo.},

Our results demonstrated that plasma cells were mainly located in the {BM}, while a higher percentage of memory B cells was in the peripheral blood than in the {BM}. The frequency of plasma and memory B cells from both sources decreased with age, while immature and naïve B cells were unaffected. An age-related decline of tetanus- and diphtheria-specific {BM} plasma cells was observed, whereas influenza A- and cytomegalovirus-specific {BM} plasma cells were not affected. With the exception of cytomegalovirus, peripheral antibody concentrations correlated with {BM} plasma cells of the same specificity, but were independent of antigen-specific peripheral blood memory B cells.

	abstract = {Diversification of the antibody repertoire is essential for the normal operation of the vertebrate adaptive immune system. Following antigen encounter, B cells are activated, proliferate rapidly and undergo two diversification events; somatic hypermutation (followed by selection), which enhances the affinity of the antibody for its cognate antigen, and class-switch recombination, which alters the effector functions of the antibody to adapt the response to the challenge faced. B cells must then differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells or long-lived memory B cells. These activities take place in specialized immunological environments called germinal centres, usually located in the secondary lymphoid organs. To complete the germinal centre activities successfully, a B cell adopts a transcriptional programme that allows it to migrate to specific sites within the germinal centre, proliferate, modify its {DNA} recombination and repair pathways, alter its apoptotic potential and finally undergo terminal differentiation. To co-ordinate these processes, B cells employ a number of 'master regulator' transcription factors which mediate wholesale transcriptomic changes. These master transcription factors are mutually antagonistic and form a complex regulatory network to maintain distinct gene expression programs. Within this network, multiple points of positive and negative feedback ensure the expression of the 'master regulators', augmented by a number of 'secondary' factors that reinforce these networks and sense the progress of the immune response. In this review we will discuss the different activities B cells must undertake to mount a successful T cell-dependent immune response and describe how a regulatory network of transcription factors controls these processes. {\textbackslash}copyright 2015 British Society for Immunology.},

Similarly, recruitment in activated splenic B cells correlates with cell division. In the latter, the recruited {IgH} allele was reported to be transcriptionally silent. However, it is not known whether monoallelic recruitment during establishment of allelic exclusion correlates with transcriptional silencing. To investigate this, we assessed the transcriptional status of both {IgH} alleles in single primary cells over the course of B-cell development, using {RNA} fluorescence in situ hybridization. Before allelic exclusion both alleles are transcribed. Thereafter, in pre-{BII} and subsequent developmental stages both functional and nonfunctional {VDJ}- and {DJ}-transcription is observed.

Morphological and molecular analyses have revealed that a stage in the middle of development–known as the phylotypic period–is conserved among species within some phyla. Although these analyses provide evidence for their existence, phyla have also been criticized as lacking an objective definition, and consequently based on arbitrary groupings of animals. Here we compare the developmental transcriptomes of ten species, each annotated to a different phylum, with a wide range of life histories and embryonic forms. We find that in all ten species, development comprises the coupling of early and late phases of conserved gene expression. These phases are linked by a divergent 'mid-developmental transition' that uses species-specific suites of signalling pathways and transcription factors. This mid-developmental transition overlaps with the phylotypic period that has been defined previously for three of the ten phyla, suggesting that transcriptional circuits and signalling mechanisms active during this transition are crucial for defining the phyletic body plan and that the mid-developmental transition may be used to define phylotypic periods in other phyla. Placing these observations alongside the reported conservation of mid-development within phyla, we propose that a phylum may be defined as a collection of species whose gene expression at the mid-developmental transition is both highly conserved among them, yet divergent relative to other species.},

To determine how such cytokine-induced isotype switch conflicts would be resolved, the responses of B cells exposed to multiple cytokines were investigated. To eliminate complications arising from simultaneous effects of switching cytokines on proliferation, division number was used as a reference framework to monitor switching rate. The results show a clear hierarchy in which {IFN}-gamma is dominant over {IL}-4, and both {IL}-4 and {IFN}-gamma are dominant over {TGF}-beta.

Evidence from controlled clinical trials has established {IVIg} as a first-line therapy for Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and multifocal motor neuropathy. {IVIg} is also an effective rescue therapy in some patients with worsening myasthenia gravis, and is beneficial as a second-line therapy for dermatomyositis and stiff-person syndrome. {IVIg} has been tested in some neurodegenerative disorders, but a controlled study in Alzheimer disease yielded disappointing results. Despite its widespread use and therapeutic success, the mechanisms of action of {IVIg} are poorly understood. Several hypotheses, based on the function of either the variable or constant {IgG} fragments, have been proposed to explain {IVIg}'s immunomodulatory activity. This Review highlights emerging data on the mechanisms of action of {IVIg} related to its anti-inflammatory activity, especially that involving the cellular Fc{\textbackslash}gamma receptors and Fc glycosylation. We also summarize recent trials in neurological diseases, discuss potential biomarkers of efficacy, offer practical guidelines on administration, and provide a rationale for experimental trials in neuroinflammatory disorders.},

Thus, parsing the relationship between allele-specific expression of these genes and disease is of interest.

Here we use single-cell {RNA} sequencing at multiple time points to dissect direct reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells. By deconstructing heterogeneity at each time point and ordering cells by transcriptome similarity, we find that the molecular reprogramming path is remarkably continuous. Overexpression of the proneural pioneer factor Ascl1 results in a well-defined initialization, causing cells to exit the cell cycle and re-focus gene expression through distinct neural transcription factors. The initial transcriptional response is relatively homogeneous among fibroblasts, suggesting that the early steps are not limiting for productive reprogramming. Instead, the later emergence of a competing myogenic program and variable transgene dynamics over time appear to be the major efficiency limits of direct reprogramming. Moreover, a transcriptional state, distinct from donor and target cell programs, is transiently induced in cells undergoing productive reprogramming. Our data provide a high-resolution approach for understanding transcriptome states during lineage differentiation.},

This combination has led to an excess of manufacturing capacity, and together with improvements in conventional purification technologies, promises nearly unlimited production capacity in the foreseeable future. The increase in titers has also led to a marked reduction in production costs, which could then become a relatively small fraction of sales price for future products which are sold at prices at or near current levels.

Bax oligomerization helps promote the diffusion of the mitochondrial contents into the cytoplasm activating the caspase cascade. In turn, Bax is regulated primarily by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins including Bcl-{xL}, which was recently shown to prevent Bax from accumulating at the mitochondria. However, the exact mechanisms by which Bcl-{xL} regulates Bax and thereby {MOMP} remain partially understood. In this study, we show that the small {CHCH}-domain-containing protein {CHCHD}2 binds to Bcl-{xL} and inhibits the mitochondrial accumulation and oligomerization of Bax. Our data show that in response to apoptotic stimuli, mitochondrial {CHCHD}2 decreases prior to {MOMP}. Furthermore, when {CHCHD}2 is absent from the mitochondria, the ability of Bcl-{xL} to inhibit Bax activation and to prevent apoptosis is attenuated, which results in increases in Bax oligomerization, {MOMP} and apoptosis. Collectively, our findings establish {CHCHD}2, a previously uncharacterized small mitochondrial protein with no known homology to the Bcl-2 family, as one of the negative regulators of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.},

This was based on several observations. First, {FLT}3 and its ligand ({FL}) were both induced by T cell activation. Second, silencing of {FLT}3 led to increased {IL}-10 levels, whereas addition of {FL} suppressed {IL}-10 secretion and increased {FLT}3 surface levels. Third, engagement of {CD}46, a known inducer of T regulatory type 1 cells, upregulated surface {FLT}3, and secreted {FL}, which then inhibited {IL}-10 production by T cells. Hence, {FL} and {FLT}3 form a novel regulatory feedback loop that limits {IL}-10 production in T cells.

	abstract = {The laboratory evolution of protease enzymes has the potential to generate proteases with therapeutically relevant specificities and to assess the vulnerability of protease inhibitor drug candidates to the evolution of drug resistance. Here we describe a system for the continuous directed evolution of proteases using phage-assisted continuous evolution ({PACE}) that links the proteolysis of a target peptide to phage propagation through a protease-activated {RNA} polymerase ({PA}-{RNAP}). We use protease {PACE} in the presence of danoprevir or asunaprevir, two hepatitis C virus ({HCV}) protease inhibitor drug candidates in clinical trials, to continuously evolve {HCV} protease variants that exhibit up to 30-fold drug resistance in only 1 to 3 days of {PACE}. The predominant mutations evolved during {PACE} are mutations observed to arise in human patients treated with danoprevir or asunaprevir, demonstrating that protease {PACE} can rapidly identify the vulnerabilities of drug candidates to the evolution of clinically relevant drug resistance.},

	abstract = {Exosomes, nano-sized membrane vesicles, are released by various cells and are found in many human body fluids. They are active players in intercellular communication and have immune-suppressive, immune-regulatory, and immune-stimulatory functions. {EBV} is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that is associated with various lymphoid and epithelial malignancies. {EBV} infection of B cells in vitro induces the release of exosomes that harbor the viral latent membrane protein 1 ({LMP}1). {LMP}1 per se mimics {CD}40 signaling and induces proliferation of B lymphocytes and T cell-independent class-switch recombination. Constitutive {LMP}1 signaling within B cells is blunted through the shedding of {LMP}1 via exosomes. In this study, we investigated the functional effect of exosomes derived from the {DG}75 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line and its sublines ({LMP}1 transfected and {EBV} infected), with the hypothesis that they might mimic exosomes released during {EBV}-associated diseases. We show that exosomes released during primary {EBV} infection of B cells harbored {LMP}1, and similar levels were detected in exosomes from {LMP}1-transfected {DG}75 cells. {DG}75 exosomes efficiently bound to human B cells within {PBMCs} and were internalized by isolated B cells. In turn, this led to proliferation, induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, and the production of circle and germline transcripts for {IgG}1 in B cells. Finally, exosomes harboring {LMP}1 enhanced proliferation and drove B cell differentiation toward a plasmablast-like phenotype. In conclusion, our results suggest that exosomes released from {EBV}-infected B cells have a stimulatory capacity and interfere with the fate of human B cells.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In utero microinjection has proven valuable for exploring the developmental consequences of altering gene expression, and for studying cell lineage or migration during the latter half of embryonic mouse development (from embryonic day 9.5 of gestation (E9.5)). In the current study, we use ultrasound guidance to accurately target microinjections in the conceptus at E6.5-E7.5, which is prior to cardiovascular or placental dependence. This method may be useful for determining the developmental effects of targeted genetic or cellular interventions at critical stages of placentation, gastrulation, axis formation, and neural tube closure. {RESULTS}: In 40 {MHz} ultrasound images at E6.5, the ectoplacental cone region and proamniotic cavity could be visualized. The ectoplacental cone region was successfully targeted with 13.8 {nL} of a fluorescent bead suspension with few or no beads off-target in 51\% of concepti microinjected at E6.5 (28/55 injected). Seventy eight percent of the embryos survived 2 to 12 days post injection (93/119), 73\% (41/56) survived to term of which 68\% (38/56) survived and appeared normal one week after birth. At E7.5, the amniotic and exocoelomic cavities, and ectoplacental cone region were discernable. Our success at targeting with few or no beads off-target was 90\% (36/40) for the ectoplacental cone region and 81\% (35/43) for the exocoelomic cavity but tended to be less, 68\% (34/50), for the smaller amniotic cavity. At E11.5, beads microinjected at E7.5 into the ectoplacental cone region were found in the placental spongiotrophoblast layer, those injected into the exocoelomic cavity were found on the surface or within the placental labyrinth, and those injected into the amniotic cavity were found on the surface or within the embryo. Following microinjection at E7.5, survival one week after birth was 60\% (26/43) when the amniotic cavity was the target and 66\% (19/29) when the target was the ectoplacental cone region. The survival rate was similar in sham experiments, 54\% (33/61), for which procedures were identical but no microinjection was performed, suggesting that surgery and manipulation of the uterus were the main causes of embryonic death. {CONCLUSION}: Ultrasound-guided microinjection into the ectoplacental cone region at E6.5 or E7.5 and the amniotic cavity at E7.5 was achieved with a 7 day postnatal survival of {\textbackslash}textgreater/=60\%. Target accuracy of these sites and of the exocoelomic cavity at E7.5 was {\textbackslash}textgreater or =51\%. We suggest that this approach may be useful for exploring gene function during early placental and embryonic development.},

	doi = {10.3791/2130},
	abstract = {Humoral immunity is the branch of the immune system maintained by B cells and mediated through the secretion of antibodies. Upon B cell activation, the immunoglobulin locus undergoes a series of genetic modifications to alter the binding capacity and effector function of secreted antibodies. This process is highlighted by a genomic recombination event known as class switch recombination ({CSR}) in which the default {IgM} antibody isotype is substituted for one of {IgG}, {IgA}, or {IgE}. Each isotype possesses distinct effector functions thereby making {CSR} crucial to the maintenance of immunity. Diversification of the immunoglobulin locus is mediated by the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase ({AID}). A schematic video describing this process in detail is available online (http://video.med.utoronto.ca/videoprojects/immunology/aam.html). {AID}'s activity and the {CSR} pathway are commonly studied in the assessment of B cell function and humoral immunity in mice. The protocol outlined in this report presents a method of B cell isolation from murine spleens and subsequent stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) to induce class switching to {IgG}3 (for other antibody isotypes see Table 1). In addition, the fluorescent cell staining dye Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ({CFSE}) is used to monitor cell division of stimulated cells, a process crucial to isotype switching. The regulation of {AID} and the mechanism by which {CSR} occurs are still unclear and thus in vitro class switch assays provide a reliable method for testing these processes in various mouse models. These assays have been previously used in the context of gene deficiency using knockout mice. Furthermore, in vitro switching of B cells can be preceded by viral transduction to modulate gene expression by {RNA} knockdown or transgene expression. The data from these types of experiments have impacted our understanding of {AID} activity, resolution of the {CSR} reaction, and antibody-mediated immunity in the mouse.},

Pretreatment of mouse nasal epithelium with the detergent lysophosphatidylcholine ({LPC}) prior to instillation of a single dose of an {LV} vector carrying the {LacZ} marker gene produced significant {LacZ} gene expression in nasal airway epithelium for at least 92 days.

Fortunately, proteogenomics enables the detection of such proteomic variations and can be defined, broadly, as the use of nucleotide sequences to generate candidate protein sequences for mass spectrometry database searching. Proteogenomics is experiencing heightened significance due to two developments: (a) advances in {DNA} sequencing technologies that have made complete sequencing of human genomes and transcriptomes routine, and (b) the unveiling of the tremendous complexity of the human proteome as expressed at the levels of genes, cells, tissues, individuals, and populations.

	abstract = {Germinal centers ({GC}) are the main sites where antigen-activated B-cell clones expand and undergo immunoglobulin gene hypermutation and selection. Iterations of this process will lead to affinity maturation, replicating Darwinian evolution on the cellular level. {GC} B-cell selection can lead to four different outcomes: further expansion and evolution, apoptosis (non-selection), or output from the {GC} with differentiation into memory B cells or plasma cells. T-helper cells in {GC} have been shown to have a central role in regulating B-cell selection by sensing the density of major histocompatibility complex ({MHC}):peptide antigen complexes. Antigen is provided on follicular dendritic cells in the form of immune complex. Antibody on these immune complexes regulates antigen accessibility by shielding antigen from B-cell receptor access. Replacement of antibody on immune complexes by antibody generated from {GC}-derived plasma cell output will gradually reduce the availability of antigen. This antibody feedback can lead to a situation where a slow rise in selection stringency caused by a changing environment leads to directional evolution toward higher affinity antibody. {\textbackslash}copyright 2016 The Authors.

We show that a subset of antibodies recognize diverse epitopes on the envelope (E) protein and exhibit potent neutralizing activity. One of the most inhibitory antibodies, {ZIKV}-117, broadly neutralized infection of {ZIKV} strains corresponding to African and Asian-American lineages. Epitope mapping studies revealed that {ZIKV}-117 recognized a unique quaternary epitope on the E protein dimer-dimer interface. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of {ZIKV}-117 in pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Monoclonal antibody treatment markedly reduced tissue pathology, placental and fetal infection, and mortality in mice. Thus, neutralizing human antibodies can protect against maternal-fetal transmission, infection and disease, and reveal important determinants for structure-based rational vaccine design efforts.},

Here we used high-resolution proteomics analysis of immunoglobulin (referred to as Ig-seq) coupled with high-throughput sequencing of transcripts encoding B cell receptors ({BCR}-seq) to quantitatively determine the antibody repertoire at the individual clonotype level in the sera of young adults before and after vaccination with trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. The serum repertoire comprised between 40 and 147 clonotypes that were specific to each of the three monovalent components of the trivalent influenza vaccine, with boosted pre-existing clonotypes accounting for ∼60\% of the response. An unexpectedly high fraction of serum antibodies recognized both the H1 and H3 monovalent vaccines. Recombinant versions of these H1 + H3 cross-reactive antibodies showed broad binding to hemagglutinins ({HAs}) from previously circulating virus strains; several of these antibodies, which were prevalent in the serum of multiple donors, recognized the same conserved epitope in the {HA} head domain. Although the {HA}-head-specific H1 + H3 antibodies did not show neutralization activity in vitro, they protected mice against infection with the H1N1 and H3N2 virus strains when administered before or after challenge. Collectively, our data reveal unanticipated insights regarding the serological response to influenza vaccination and raise questions about the added benefits of using a quadrivalent vaccine instead of a trivalent vaccine.},

Current screening methods can only be used to disrupt a gene or alter its expression. Here we report the fusion of activation-induced cytidine deaminase ({AID}) with nuclease-inactive clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ({CRISPR})-associated protein 9 ({dCas}9) for efficient genetic diversification, which enabled high-throughput screening of functional variants. Guided by single guide (sg){RNAs}, {dCas}9-{AID}-P182X ({AIDx}) directly changed cytidines or guanines to the other three bases independent of {AID} hotspot motifs, generating a large repertoire of variants at desired loci. Coupled with a uracil-{DNA} glycosylase inhibitor, {dCas}9-{AIDx} converted targeted cytidines specifically to thymines, creating specific point mutations. By targeting {BCR}-{ABL} with {dCas}9-{AIDx}, we efficiently identified known and new mutations conferring imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Thus, targeted {AID}-mediated mutagenesis ({TAM}) provides a forward genetic tool to screen for gain-of-function variants at base resolution.},

Here we show that regular nutrient provision stabilizes exponential growth of E. coli, with the stationary phase occurring 20 min after nutrient supply accompanied by bacterial proteome changes, suggesting involvement of bacterial proteins in host satiety. Indeed, intestinal infusions of E. coli stationary phase proteins increased plasma {PYY} and their intraperitoneal injections suppressed acutely food intake and activated c-Fos in hypothalamic {POMC} neurons, while their repeated administrations reduced meal size. {ClpB}, a bacterial protein mimetic of {\textbackslash}alpha-{MSH}, was upregulated in the E. coli stationary phase, was detected in plasma proportional to {ClpB} {DNA} in feces, and stimulated firing rate of hypothalamic {POMC} neurons. Thus, these data show that bacterial proteins produced after nutrient-induced E. coli growth may signal meal termination. Furthermore, continuous exposure to E. coli proteins may influence long-term meal pattern. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {HIV}-1 relies on the host {ESCRTs} for release from cells. {HIV}-1 Gag engages {ESCRTs} by directly binding {TSG}101 or Alix. {ESCRTs} also sort ubiquitinated membrane proteins through endosomes to facilitate their lysosomal degradation. The ability of {ESCRTs} to recognize and process ubiquitinated proteins suggests that {ESCRT}-dependent viral release may also be controlled by ubiquitination. Although both Gag and {ESCRTs} undergo some level of ubiquitination, definitive demonstration that ubiquitin is required for viral release is lacking. Here we suppress ubiquitination at viral budding sites by fusing the catalytic domain of the Herpes Simplex {UL}36 deubiquitinating enzyme ({DUb}) onto {TSG}101, Alix, or Gag. {RESULTS}: Expressing {DUb}-{TSG}101 suppressed Alix-independent {HIV}-1 release and viral particles remained tethered to the cell surface. {DUb}-{TSG}101 had no effect on budding of {MoMLV} or {EIAV}, two retroviruses that rely on the {ESCRT} machinery for exit. Alix-dependent virus release such as {EIAV}'s, and {HIV}-1 lacking access to {TSG}101, was instead dramatically blocked by co-expressing {DUb}-Alix. Finally, Gag-{DUb} was unable to support virus release and dominantly interfered with release of wild type {HIV}-1. Fusion of {UL}36 did not effect interactions with Alix, {TSG}101, or Gag and all of the inhibitory effects of {UL}36 fusion were abolished when its catalytic activity was ablated. Accordingly, Alix, {TSG}101 and Gag fused to inactive {UL}36 functionally replaced their unfused counterparts. Interestingly, coexpression of the Nedd4-2s ubiquitin ligase suppressed the ability of {DUb}-{TSG}101 to inhibit {HIV}-1 release while also restoring detectable Gag ubiquitination at the membrane. Similarly, incorporation of Gag-Ub fusion proteins into virions lifted {DUb}-{ESCRT} inhibitory effect. In contrast, Nedd4-2s did not suppress the inhibition mediated by Gag-{DUb} despite restoring robust ubiquitination of {TSG}101/{ESCRT}-I at virus budding sites. {CONCLUSIONS}: These studies demonstrate a necessary and natural role for ubiquitin in {ESCRT}-dependent viral release and indicate a critical role for ubiquitination of Gag rather than ubiquitination of {ESCRTs} themselves.},

Paradoxically, control of protocell reproduction would seem to require evolved replicators. We show here that a simpler population structure, based on cycles of transient compartmentalization ({TC}) and mixing of {RNA} replicators, is sufficient to prevent takeover by parasitic mutants. {TC} tends to select for ensembles of replicators that replicate at a similar rate, including a diversity of parasites that could serve as a source of opportunistic functionality.

To probe how polarity proteins regulate phase separation, we combined biochemistry and theoretical modeling. We reconstitute P granule-like droplets in vitro using a single protein {PGL}-3. By combining in vitro reconstitution with measurements of intracellular concentrations, we show that competition between {PGL}-3 and {MEX}-5 for {mRNA} can regulate the formation of {PGL}-3 droplets. Using theory, we show that, in a {MEX}-5 gradient, this {mRNA} competition mechanism can drive a gradient of P granule assembly with similar spatial and temporal characteristics to P granule assembly in vivo.

The remaining variables, or the so called hidden variables, are most likely coupled to the observed ones, and affect their statistics and consequently our inference about the function of the system and the way it performs this function. Two important questions then arise in this context: which variables should we choose to observe and collect data from? and how much can we learn from data in the presence of hidden variables?

Data accumulated during the past decade have significantly advanced our understanding of how {AID} activity is regulated and preferentially targeted to the immunoglobulin genes. There is also a better understanding of the ways by which {AID}-catalyzed uracil is recognized and the ensuing downstream processing underpinning the mechanisms of somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination.

	abstract = {In eukaryotes, up to one-third of cellular proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they undergo folding, processing, sorting and trafficking to subsequent endomembrane compartments. Targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum has been shown to occur co-translationally by the signal recognition particle ({SRP}) pathway or post-translationally by the mammalian transmembrane recognition complex of 40 {kDa} ({TRC}40) and homologous yeast guided entry of tail-anchored proteins ({GET}) pathways. Despite the range of proteins that can be catered for by these two pathways, many proteins are still known to be independent of both {SRP} and {GET}, so there seems to be a critical need for an additional dedicated pathway for endoplasmic reticulum relay. We set out to uncover additional targeting proteins using unbiased high-content screening approaches. To this end, we performed a systematic visual screen using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and uncovered three uncharacterized proteins whose loss affected targeting. We suggest that these proteins work together and demonstrate that they function in parallel with {SRP} and {GET} to target a broad range of substrates to the endoplasmic reticulum. The three proteins, which we name Snd1, Snd2 and Snd3 (for {SRP}-independent targeting), can synthetically compensate for the loss of both the {SRP} and {GET} pathways, and act as a backup targeting system. This explains why it has previously been difficult to demonstrate complete loss of targeting for some substrates. Our discovery thus puts in place an essential piece of the endoplasmic reticulum targeting puzzle, highlighting how the targeting apparatus of the eukaryotic cell is robust, interlinked and flexible.},

Finally, we found that {CD}19(-){CD}38(hi){CD}138(+) {PCs} had a distinct {RNA} transcriptome signature and human immunoglobulin heavy chain ({VH}) repertoire that was relatively uncoupled from other {BM} {PC} subsets and probably represents the B cell response's "historical record" of antigenic exposure. Thus, our studies define human {LLPCs} and provide a mechanism for the life-long maintenance of anti-viral antibodies in the serum. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While Smart-seq2 detected the most genes per cell and across cells, {CEL}-seq2, Drop-seq, {MARS}-seq, and {SCRB}-seq quantified {mRNA} levels with less amplification noise due to the use of unique molecular identifiers ({UMIs}). Power simulations at different sequencing depths showed that Drop-seq is more cost-efficient for transcriptome quantification of large numbers of cells, while {MARS}-seq, {SCRB}-seq, and Smart-seq2 are more efficient when analyzing fewer cells.

To address these questions, researchers have begun to reconstitute signaling pathways in living cells, analyzing their dynamic responses to stimuli, and developing new functional representations of their behavior.

One of the key advantages of oligonucleotide drugs is that their delivery and potency are derived primarily from the chemical structure of the oligonucleotide whereas their target is defined by the base sequence. Thus, as oligonucleotides with a particular chemical design show appropriate distribution and safety profiles for clinical gene silencing in a particular tissue, this will open the door to the rapid development of additional drugs targeting other disease-associated genes in the same tissue. To achieve clinical productivity, the chemical architecture of the oligonucleotide needs to be optimized with a combination of sugar, backbone, nucleobase, and 3'- and 5'-terminal modifications. A portfolio of chemistries can be used to confer drug-like properties onto the oligonucleotide as a whole, with minor chemical changes often translating into major improvements in clinical efficacy. One outstanding challenge in oligonucleotide chemical development is the optimization of chemical architectures to ensure long-term safety. There are multiple designs that enable effective targeting of the liver, but a second challenge is to develop architectures that enable robust clinical efficacy in additional tissues.},

Arc expression is highly dynamic, and tightly regulated by neuronal activity and experience. Local translation of Arc protein at synapses is critical for synaptic plasticity, which is mediated by Arc-dependent trafficking of {AMPA} ({\textbackslash}alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid)-type glutamate receptors. To date, few structural or biophysical properties of Arc protein have been investigated. Recent studies, including that of Myrum et al. published in the 468:1 issue of the Biochemical Journal, now shed light on some intriguing biophysical properties of Arc. These findings show that Arc contains large N- and C-terminal domains around a flexible linker region and that purified Arc protein is capable of self-oligomerization. Intriguingly, these domains show homology with the viral capsid protein found in the gag polypeptide of most retroviruses. These studies provide insight into how Arc may regulate multiple critical cell biological processes in neurons and reveals unanticipated biology that resembles viral trafficking in cells. {\textbackslash}copyright 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.},

The most well characterized regulatory drivers are in the {TERT} promoter and have been identified in many cancer types. Despite the larger fraction of somatic variants occurring in non-coding regions, the number of non-coding drivers identified so far is much less than the number of coding region drivers.

	abstract = {To maintain Ab titers, individual plasma cells must survive for extended periods, perhaps even for the life of the host. Although it is clear that plasma cell survival requires cell extrinsic signals, the nature and source of these signals remains open for debate. It is commonly postulated that plasma cells only gain access to these signals within specialized regulatory microenvironments, or niches, in the bone marrow or in the gut. In this review we discuss current concepts and information surrounding plasma cell survival niches, and consider two opposing models to explain long-term serologic immunity.

	abstract = {Angelman syndrome ({AS}) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results from deletions or mutations in chromosome 15, which usually includes the {UBE}3A gene. Ube3A protein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates proteins and targets them for degradation. The immediate-early gene Arc, a master regulator of synaptic plasticity, was identified as a putative substrate of Ube3A, but there have been conflicting reports on whether Arc is a bona fide E3 ligase substrate. Using multiple approaches, we found no evidence for a physical interaction between Arc and Ube3A in vivo. Nonetheless, activity-induced subcellular distribution of Arc is altered in brains from Ube3am-/p+ mice, with abnormal concentration of Arc at synapses. Furthermore, although activation of Arc transcription is normal, the stability of Arc protein is enhanced in dendrites of hippocampal neurons cultured from Ube3am-/p+ mice. Finally, homeostatic synaptic scaling of surface {AMPA} receptors does not occur in Ube3am-/p+ hippocampal neurons, reminiscent of neurons that lack Arc protein. Although Ube3A does not seem to bind Arc in a canonical E3 ligase-substrate interaction, Arc-dependent synaptic plasticity is still altered in Ube3am-/p+ mice, which may underlie the cognitive deficits observed in {AS}.},

	abstract = {La was first identified as a polypeptide component of ribonucleic protein complexes targeted by antibodies in autoimmune patients and is now known to be a eukaryote cell-ubiquitous protein. Structure and function studies have shown that La binds to a common terminal motif, {UUU}-3'-{OH}, of nascent {RNA} polymerase {III} ({RNAP} {III}) transcripts and protects them from exonucleolytic decay. For precursor-{tRNAs}, the most diverse and abundant of these transcripts, La also functions as an {RNA} chaperone that helps to prevent their misfolding. Related to this, we review evidence that suggests that La and its link to {RNAP} {III} were significant in the great expansions of the {tRNAomes} that occurred in eukaryotes. Four families of La-related proteins ({LARPs}) emerged during eukaryotic evolution with specialized functions. We provide an overview of the high-resolution structural biology of La and {LARPs}. {LARP}7 family members most closely resemble La but function with a single {RNAP} {III} nuclear transcript, 7SK, or telomerase {RNA}. A cytoplasmic isoform of La protein as well as {LARPs} 6, 4, and 1 function in {mRNA} metabolism and translation in distinct but similar ways, sometimes with the poly(A)-binding protein, and in some cases by direct binding to poly(A)-{RNA}. New structures of {LARP} domains, some complexed with {RNA}, provide novel insights into the functional versatility of these proteins. We also consider {LARPs} in relation to ancestral La protein and potential retention of links to specific {RNA}-related pathways. One such link may be {tRNA} surveillance and codon usage by {LARP}-associated {mRNAs}. {WIREs} {RNA} 2017, 8:e1430. doi: 10.1002/wrna.1430 For further resources related to this article, please visit the {WIREs} website. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The vast dynamic range and high complexity of the plasma proteome have, however, proven to be serious challenges and have often led to unacceptable tradeoffs between depth of coverage and sample throughput. We present an optimized sample-processing pipeline for analysis of the human plasma proteome that provides greatly increased depth of detection, improved quantitative precision and much higher sample analysis throughput as compared with prior methods. The process includes abundant protein depletion, isobaric labeling at the peptide level for multiplexed relative quantification and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to accurate-mass, high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry analysis of peptides fractionated off-line by basic {pH} reversed-phase ({bRP}) chromatography. The overall reproducibility of the process, including immunoaffinity depletion, is high, with a process replicate coefficient of variation ({CV}) of {\textbackslash}textless 12\%. Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation ({iTRAQ}) 4-plex, {\textbackslash}textgreater4,500 proteins are detected and quantified per patient sample on average, with two or more peptides per protein and starting from as little as 200 μl of plasma. The approach can be multiplexed up to 10-plex using tandem mass tags ({TMT}) reagents, further increasing throughput, albeit with some decrease in the number of proteins quantified. In addition, we provide a rapid protocol for analysis of nonfractionated depleted plasma samples analyzed in 10-plex. This provides ∼600 quantified proteins for each of the ten samples in ∼5 h of instrument time.},

In vitro reconstitution studies suggest that the structure and the dynamics of actin networks respond to mechanical forces. We demonstrate that lamellipodial actin of migrating cells responds to mechanical load when membrane tension is modulated. In a steady state, migrating cell filaments assume the canonical dendritic geometry, defined by Arp2/3-generated 70° branch points. Increased tension triggers a dense network with a broadened range of angles, whereas decreased tension causes a shift to a sparse configuration dominated by filaments growing perpendicularly to the plasma membrane. We show that these responses emerge from the geometry of branched actin: when load per filament decreases, elongation speed increases and perpendicular filaments gradually outcompete others because they polymerize the shortest distance to the membrane, where they are protected from capping. This network-intrinsic geometrical adaptation mechanism tunes protrusive force in response to mechanical load. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mammalian excitatory synapses express diverse types of synaptic plasticity. A major challenge in neuroscience is to understand how a neuron utilizes different types of plasticity to sculpt brain development, function, and behavior. Neuronal activity-induced expression of the immediate early protein, Arc, is critical for long-term potentiation and depression of synaptic transmission, homeostatic synaptic scaling, and adaptive functions such as long-term memory formation. However, the molecular basis of Arc protein function as a regulator of synaptic plasticity and cognition remains a puzzle. Recent work on the biophysical and structural properties of Arc, its protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications have shed light on the issue. Here, we present Arc protein as a flexible, multifunctional and interactive hub. Arc interacts with specific effector proteins in neuronal compartments (dendritic spines, nuclear domains) to bidirectionally regulate synaptic strength by distinct molecular mechanisms. Arc stability, subcellular localization, and interactions are dictated by synaptic activity and post-translational modification of Arc. This functional versatility and context-dependent signaling supports a view of Arc as a highly specialized master organizer of long-term synaptic plasticity, critical for information storage and cognition.

	abstract = {The function of a neural circuit is determined by the details of its synaptic connections. At present, the only available method for determining a neural wiring diagram with single synapse precision-a 'connectome'-is based on imaging methods that are slow, labor-intensive and expensive. Here, we present {SYNseq}, a method for converting the connectome into a form that can exploit the speed and low cost of modern high-throughput {DNA} sequencing. In {SYNseq}, each neuron is labeled with a unique random nucleotide sequence-an {RNA} 'barcode'-which is targeted to the synapse using engineered proteins. Barcodes in pre- and postsynaptic neurons are then associated through protein-protein crosslinking across the synapse, extracted from the tissue, and joined into a form suitable for sequencing. Although our failure to develop an efficient barcode joining scheme precludes the widespread application of this approach, we expect that with further development {SYNseq} will enable tracing of complex circuits at high speed and low cost. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2017.

Since the introduction of {CRISPR}-Cas9, genome editing has become widely used in transformable plants for characterizing gene function and improving traits, mainly by inducing mutations through non-homologous end joining of double-stranded breaks generated by {CRISPR}-Cas9. However, it would be highly desirable to perform precision gene editing in plants, especially in transformation-recalcitrant species. Recently developed Cas9 variants, novel {RNA}-guided nucleases and base-editing systems, and {DNA}-free {CRISPR}-Cas9 delivery methods now provide great opportunities for plant genome engineering. In this Review Article, we describe the current status of plant genome editing, focusing on newly developed genome editing tools and methods and their potential applications in plants.

The deamination of adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, but no enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in {DNA}. Here we describe adenine base editors ({ABEs}) that mediate the conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic {DNA}. We evolved a transfer {RNA} adenosine deaminase to operate on {DNA} when fused to a catalytically impaired {CRISPR}-Cas9 mutant. Extensive directed evolution and protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation {ABEs} that convert targeted A•T base pairs efficiently to G•C (approximately 50\% efficiency in human cells) with high product purity (typically at least 99.9\%) and low rates of indels (typically no more than 0.1\%). {ABEs} introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly, and with less off-target genome modification, than a current Cas9 nuclease-based method, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in human cells. Together with previous base editors, {ABEs} enable the direct, programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without double-stranded {DNA} cleavage.},

A limitation of current methods for human B cell culture is the capacity to support mature B cell proliferation. We developed a culture method to support the efficient activation and proliferation of naive and memory human B cells. This culture supports extensive B cell proliferation, with ∼103-fold increases following 8 d in culture and 106-fold increases when cultures are split and cultured for 8 more days. In culture, a significant fraction of naive B cells undergo isotype switching and differentiate into plasmacytes. Culture-derived ({CD}) B cells are readily cryopreserved and, when recovered, retain their ability to proliferate and differentiate. Significantly, proliferating {CD} B cells express high levels of {MHC} class {II}, {CD}80, and {CD}86. {CD} B cells act as {APCs} and present alloantigens and microbial Ags to T cells. We are able to activate and expand Ag-specific memory B cells; these cultured cells are highly effective in presenting Ag to T cells. We characterized the {TCR} repertoire of rare Ag-specific {CD}4+ T cells that proliferated in response to tetanus toxoid ({TT}) presented by autologous {CD} B cells. {TCR} V{\textbackslash}beta usage by {TT}-activated {CD}4+ T cells differs from resting and unspecifically activated {CD}4+ T cells. Moreover, we found that {TT}-specific {TCR} V{\textbackslash}beta usage by {CD}4+ T cells was substantially different between donors.

Such frequent joining of widely separated {CSR} {DSBs} could be promoted by {IgH}-specific or B-cell-specific processes or by general aspects of chromosome architecture and {DSB} repair. Previously, we found that B cells with two yeast I-{SceI} endonuclease targets in place of S{\textbackslash}gamma1 undergo I-{SceI}-dependent class switching from {IgM} to {IgG}1 at 5-10\% of normal levels. Now, we report that B cells in which S{\textbackslash}gamma1 is replaced with a 28 I-{SceI} target array, designed to increase I-{SceI} {DSB} frequency, undergo I-{SceI}-dependent class switching at almost normal levels. High-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing revealed that I-{SceI}-generated {DSBs} introduced in cis at Sμ and S{\textbackslash}gamma1 sites are joined together in T cells at levels similar to those of B cells. Such high joining levels also occurred between I-{SceI}-generated {DSBs} within c-myc and I-{SceI}- or {CRISPR}/Cas9-generated {DSBs} 100 kb downstream within Pvt1 in B cells or fibroblasts, respectively. We suggest that {CSR} exploits a general propensity of intrachromosomal {DSBs} separated by several hundred kilobases to be frequently joined together and discuss the relevance of this finding for recurrent interstitial deletions in cancer.},

We measured the dynamics and genetic diversity of B cell responses of five adults longitudinally before and after influenza vaccination using high-throughput antibody repertoire sequencing. We identified vaccine-responsive B cell lineages that carry signatures of selective sweeps driven by positive selection, and discovered that they often display evidence for selective sweeps favoring multiple subclones. We also found persistent B cell lineages that exhibit stable population dynamics and carry signatures of neutral drift. By exploiting the linkage between B cell fitness and antibody binding affinity, we demonstrated the potential for using signatures of selection to identify antibodies with high binding affinity. This quantitative characterization reveals that antibody repertoires are shaped by an unexpectedly broad spectrum of evolutionary processes and shows how signatures of evolutionary history can be harnessed for antibody discovery and engineering.},

We demonstrate the utility of the assay by isolating Ag-reactive plasmablasts from cryopreserved {PBMC} obtained from volunteers vaccinated with a recombinant {HIV} envelope protein. To show the specificity of the {ICA}, we produced Ag-specific Abs from these cells and subsequently verified their Ag reactivity via {ELISA}. Furthermore, we used the {ICA} to track Ag-specific plasmablast responses in {HIV}-vaccine recipients over a period of 42 d and performed a head-to-head comparison with a conventional B cell {ELISpot}. Results were highly comparable, highlighting that this assay is a viable alternative for monitoring Ag-specific plasmablast responses at early time points after infection or vaccination. The {ICA} provides important added benefits in that phenotypic information can be obtained from the identified Ag-specific cells that can then be captured for downstream applications such as B cell sequencing and/or Ab cloning.

However, a general understanding of {RNA} localization has been hindered by a lack of simple, high-throughput methods for mapping the transcriptomes of subcellular compartments. Here, we develop such a method, termed {APEX}-{RIP}, which combines peroxidase-catalyzed, spatially restricted in situ protein biotinylation with {RNA}-protein chemical crosslinking. We demonstrate that, using a single protocol, {APEX}-{RIP} can isolate {RNAs} from a variety of subcellular compartments, including the mitochondrial matrix, nucleus, cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}), with specificity and sensitivity that rival or exceed those of conventional approaches. We further identify candidate {RNAs} localized to mitochondria-{ER} junctions and nuclear lamina, two compartments that are recalcitrant to classical biochemical purification. Since {APEX}-{RIP} is simple, versatile, and does not require special instrumentation, we envision its broad application in a variety of biological contexts.},

	abstract = {Meniere's disease ({MD}) is a disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo attacks, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness. The aetiology of {MD} is multifactorial. A characteristic sign of {MD} is endolymphatic hydrops ({EH}), a disorder in which excessive endolymph accumulates in the inner ear and causes damage to the ganglion cells. In most patients, the clinical symptoms of {MD} present after considerable accumulation of endolymph has occurred. However, some patients develop symptoms in the early stages of {EH}. The reason for the variability in the symptomatology is unknown and the relationship between {EH} and the clinical symptoms of {MD} requires further study. The diagnosis of {MD} is based on clinical symptoms but can be complemented with functional inner ear tests, including audiometry, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential testing, caloric testing, electrocochleography or head impulse tests. {MRI} has been optimized to directly visualize {EH} in the cochlea, vestibule and semicircular canals, and its use is shifting from the research setting to the clinic. The management of {MD} is mainly aimed at the relief of acute attacks of vertigo and the prevention of recurrent attacks. Therapeutic options are based on empirical evidence and include the management of risk factors and a conservative approach as the first line of treatment. When medical treatment is unable to suppress vertigo attacks, intratympanic gentamicin therapy or endolymphatic sac decompression surgery is usually considered. This Primer covers the pathophysiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, management, quality of life and prevention of {MD}.},

Despite its popularity, bioluminescence has long been hindered by a lack of distinguishable probes. Here we present a method to rapidly identify new substrate-selective luciferases for multicomponent imaging. Our strategy relies on parallel screening of luciferin analogues with panels of mutant enzymes. The compiled data set is then analyzed in silico to uncover mutually orthogonal sets. Using this approach, we screened 159 mutant enzymes with 12 luciferins. Thousands of orthogonal pairs were revealed with sufficient selectivity for use in biological environments. Over 100 pairs were validated in vitro, and three were applied in cell and animal models. The parallel screening method is both generalizable and scalable and will streamline the search for larger collections of orthogonal probes.},

	abstract = {Arc/Arg3.1 is required for synaptic plasticity and cognition, and mutations in this gene are linked to autism and schizophrenia. Arc bears a domain resembling retroviral/retrotransposon Gag-like proteins, which multimerize into a capsid that packages viral {RNA}. The significance of such a domain in a plasticity molecule is uncertain. Here, we report that the Drosophila Arc1 protein forms capsid-like structures that bind darc1 {mRNA} in neurons and is loaded into extracellular vesicles that are transferred from motorneurons to muscles. This loading and transfer depends on the darc1-{mRNA} 3' untranslated region, which contains retrotransposon-like sequences. Disrupting transfer blocks synaptic plasticity, suggesting that transfer of {dArc}1 complexed with its {mRNA} is required for this function. Notably, cultured cells also release extracellular vesicles containing the Gag region of the Copia retrotransposon complexed with its own {mRNA}. Taken together, our results point to a trans-synaptic {mRNA} transport mechanism involving retrovirus-like capsids and extracellular vesicles. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, little is known about Arc's molecular function and evolutionary origins. Here, we show that Arc self-assembles into virus-like capsids that encapsulate {RNA}. Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles that mediate the transfer of Arc {mRNA} into new target cells, where it can undergo activity-dependent translation. Purified Arc capsids are endocytosed and are able to transfer Arc {mRNA} into the cytoplasm of neurons. These results show that Arc exhibits similar molecular properties to retroviral Gag proteins. Evolutionary analysis indicates that Arc is derived from a vertebrate lineage of Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons, which are also ancestors to retroviruses. These findings suggest that Gag retroelements have been repurposed during evolution to mediate intercellular communication in the nervous system.

We show that multiple germline genes are constitutively transcribed in the majority of naive human B cells in a population. Thus, because chromatin in its higher order structure cannot be transcribed, the entire Ig H chain locus must be unfolded in naive B cells. We have also established that {IL}-4 and anti-{CD}40 act by enhancing transcription in the majority of cells, rather than by activating transcription in more of the cells. Transcriptional activity in the human H chain locus rules out the perturbation of chromatin higher order structure as a factor in isotype determination. We have also found that the levels of germline gene transcription cannot fully account for the levels of secretion of the different Ig isotypes, and that secretion of {IgE}, in particular, is suppressed relative to that of {IgG}.},

In particular, phenotypically similar repertoires will in general be completely different at the sequence level because of cross-reactivity.

A remarkable property of these circuits is their ability to function in highly variable biological environments: Biochemical processes are stochastic, environmental conditions fluctuate, and genetic polymorphisms are abundant. How is variability buffered to maintain a robust output? Can variability be exploited to allow computations not possible by deterministic dynamics? These questions lie at the heart of contemporary systems biology. We argue here that biological variability is fundamental for understanding principles underlying design and function of biological circuits. As concrete examples, we will discuss the buffering of variability during embryonic patterning, and the incorporation of variability in microbial responses to changing conditions.},

	abstract = {Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells typically requires the ectopic expression of transcription factors to reactivate the pluripotency network. However, it remains largely unclear what remodeling events on endogenous chromatin trigger reprogramming toward induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs}). Toward this end, we employed {CRISPR} activation to precisely target and remodel endogenous gene loci of Oct4 and Sox2. Interestingly, we found that single-locus targeting of Sox2 was sufficient to remodel and activate Sox2, which was followed by the induction of other pluripotent genes and establishment of the pluripotency network. Simultaneous remodeling of the Oct4 promoter and enhancer also triggered reprogramming. Authentic pluripotent cell lines were established in both cases. Finally, we showed that targeted manipulation of histone acetylation at the Oct4 gene locus could also initiate reprogramming. Our study generated authentic {iPSCs} with {CRISPR} activation through precise epigenetic remodeling of endogenous loci and shed light on how targeted chromatin remodeling triggers pluripotency induction.

This complex is assembled in stages by the interaction of transcription factors with the template and/or with each other. We report on the ability of six drugs to inhibit the assembly of the {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription complex. Assembly of the complex on the adenovirus major late promoter requires several transcription factors. The normal assembly process requires that the {DNA} first interact with {TFIIA}, then with {TFIID}, and finally with at least four additional transcription factors (one of which is {RNA} polymerase {II}). We observed that streptolydigin (10 micrograms/ml) inhibits association of {ILA} and {IID}, and at higher concentrations (100 micrograms/ml) inhibits that {IIA}/{IID} complex from binding to {DNA}. Streptovaricin (100 micrograms/ml) appears to inhibit the {IIA}/{IID} interaction with {DNA} and prevents reinitiation (at 500 micrograms/ml). Adriamycin (1 microgram/ml) inhibits the interaction of {TFIID} with the {IIA}/{DNA} complex and inhibits an additional event immediately prior to, or during, elongation. Daunorubicin may be an elongation inhibitor. Heparin at 10 micrograms/ml inhibits further assembly after the {IIA}/{IID}/{DNA} complex has formed, and at 100 micrograms/ml also inhibits a late event in the assembly process and blocks reinitiation. Rifamycin {AF}/013 (100 micrograms/ml) inhibits the early events necessary to form the {IIA}/{IID}/{DNA} complex and (at 10 micrograms/ml) an assembly event following formation of the {IIA}/{IID}/{DNA} complex. Therefore, these compounds should be useful as probes for further examination of the assembly process.},

	abstract = {Activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc, also known as activity-regulated gene 3.1 or Arg3.1) is induced in neurons in response to salient experience and neural activity and is necessary for activity-induced forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation ({LTP}) and long-term depression ({LTD}), cellular substrates of learning and memory. The best-characterized function of Arc is enhancement of the endocytic internalization of {AMPA} receptors in dendritic spines, a process associated with {LTD}. Arc has also been implicated in the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein on the surface of endosomes. To mediate these activities, Arc must associate with cellular membranes, but it is unclear whether Arc binds directly to the lipid bilayer or requires protein-protein interactions for membrane recruitment. In this study, we show that Arc associates with pure phospholipid vesicles in vitro and undergoes palmitoylation in neurons, a modification that allows it to insert directly into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. The palmitoylated cysteines are clustered in a motif, 94CLCRC98, located in the N-terminal half of the protein, which has not yet been structurally characterized. Expression of Arc with three mutated cysteines in that motif cannot support synaptic depression induced by the activity-dependent transcription factor, {MEF}2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2), in contrast to wild-type Arc. Thus, it appears that palmitoylation regulates at least a subset of Arc functions in synaptic plasticity.},

The pulse labeling of cells with radioactive thymidine provides a means to determine the distribution of times of entry into the first cell division. We derive in analytic form the number of cells in each division class as a function of time using the cyton approach that utilizes independent stochastic distributions for the time to divide and the time to die. We confirm that our analytic form for the number of cells in each division class is consistent with the numerical solution of a set of delay differential equations representing the generalized Smith-Martin model with cell death rates depending on the division class. Choosing the distribution of time to the first division to fit thymidine labeling data for B cells stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) and either with or without interleukin-4 ({IL}-4), we fit {CFSE} data to determine the dependence of B cell kinetic parameters on the presence of {IL}-4. We find when {IL}-4 is present, a greater proportion of cells are recruited into division with a longer average time to first division. The most profound effect of the presence of {IL}-4 was decreased death rates for smaller division classes, which supports a role of {IL}-4 in the protection of B cells from apoptosis.},

Members of a clonal lineage from one donor had a {BCR} structure similar to that of a previously described Ab, encoded by different gene segments.

	abstract = {Activation induced proliferation and clonal expansion of antigen specific lymphocytes is a hallmark of the adaptive immune response to pathogens. Recent studies identify two distinct control phases. In the first T and B lymphocytes integrate antigen and additional costimuli to motivate a programmed proliferative burst that ceases with a return to cell quiescence and eventual death. This proliferative burst is autonomously timed, ensuring an appropriate response magnitude whilst preventing uncontrolled expansion. This initial response is subject to further modification and extension by a range of signals that modify, expand and direct the emergence of a rich array of new cell types. Thus, both robust clonal expansion of a small number of antigen specific T cells, and the concurrent emergence of extensive cellular diversity, confers immunity to a vast array of different pathogens. The in vivo response to a given pathogen is made up by the sum of all responding clones and is reproducible and pathogen specific. Thus, a precise description of the regulatory principles governing lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation and survival is essential to a unified understanding of the immune system.

In this study, we further assessed the variables that regulate B cell division destiny in vitro in response to T cell- and {TLR}-dependent stimuli. Both the concentration and duration of stimulation were able to regulate the average maximum number of divisions undergone for each stimulus. Notably, a maximum division destiny was reached during provision of repeated saturating stimulation, revealing that an intrinsic limit to proliferation exists even under these conditions. This limit was linked directly to division number rather than time of exposure to stimulation and operated independently of the survival regulation of the cells. These results demonstrate that a B cell population's division destiny is regulable by the stimulatory conditions up to an inherent maximum value. Division destiny is a crucial parameter in regulating the extent of B cell responses and thereby also the nature of the immune response mounted.},

After labeling, {CFSE} is attached to free amine groups and intracellular proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleus of a cell, and halves in fluorescence intensity with each round of cell division, enabling enumeration of the number of divisions a cell has undergone. A range of popular division tracking dyes were subsequently developed, including {CellTrace} Violet ({CTV}), making available the green fluorescent channel previously occupied by {CFSE}. More recently, {CellTrace} Yellow ({CTY}) and {CellTrace} Far Red ({CTFR}), each with unique fluorescence properties, were introduced. In a comparison, we found that the fluorescence values of both dyes were well separated from autofluorescence, and enabled a greater number of divisions to be identified than {CTV}, before this limit was reached. These new dyes provided clear and well-separated peaks for both murine and human B lymphocytes, and should find wide application. The range of excitation/emission spectra available for division tracking dyes now also facilitates multiplexing, that is, the labeling of cells with different combinations of dyes to give a unique fluorescence signature, allowing single cell in vitro and in vivo tracking. The combinatorial possibilities are significantly increased with these additional dyes. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 The Authors Immunology and Cell Biology published by John Wiley \& Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Australasian Society for Immunology Inc.},

	abstract = {Like other retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) selectively packages genomic {RNA} ({gRNA}) during virus assembly. However, in the absence of the {gRNA}, cellular messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}) are packaged. While the {gRNA} is selected because of its cis-acting packaging signal, the mechanism of this selection is not understood. The affinity of Gag (the viral structural protein) for cellular {RNAs} at physiological ionic strength is not much higher than that for the {gRNA}. However, binding to the {gRNA} is more salt-resistant, implying that it has a higher non-electrostatic component. We have previously studied the spacer 1 ({SP}1) region of Gag and showed that it can undergo a concentration-dependent conformational transition. We proposed that this transition represents the first step in assembly, i.e., the conversion of Gag to an assembly-ready state. To explain selective packaging of {gRNA}, we suggest here that binding of Gag to {gRNA}, with its high non-electrostatic component, triggers this conversion more readily than binding to other {RNAs}; thus we predict that a Gag-{gRNA} complex will nucleate particle assembly more efficiently than other Gag-{RNA} complexes. New data shows that among cellular {mRNAs}, those with long 3'-untranslated regions ({UTR}) are selectively packaged. It seems plausible that the 3'-{UTR}, a stretch of {RNA} not occupied by ribosomes, offers a favorable binding site for Gag.},

	abstract = {The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) protein controls synaptic strength by facilitating {AMPA} receptor ({AMPAR}) endocytosis. Here we demonstrate that Arc targets {AMPAR} to be internalized through a direct interaction with the clathrin-adaptor protein 2 ({AP}-2). We show that Arc overexpression in dissociated hippocampal neurons obtained from C57BL/6 mouse reduces the density of {AMPAR} {GluA}1 subunits at the cell surface and reduces the amplitude and rectification of {AMPAR}-mediated miniature-{EPSCs} ({mEPSCs}). Mutations of Arc, that prevent the {AP}-2 interaction reduce Arc-mediated endocytosis of {GluA}1 and abolish the reduction in {AMPAR}-mediated {mEPSC} amplitude and rectification. Depletion of the {AP}-2 subunit {\textbackslash}mu2 blocks the Arc-mediated reduction in {mEPSC} amplitude, an effect that is restored by reintroducing {\textbackslash}mu2. The Arc-{AP}-2 interaction plays an important role in homeostatic synaptic scaling as the Arc-dependent decrease in {mEPSC} amplitude, induced by a chronic increase in neuronal activity, is inhibited by {AP}-2 depletion. These data provide a mechanism to explain how activity-dependent expression of Arc decisively controls the fate of {AMPAR} at the cell surface and modulates synaptic strength, via the direct interaction with the endocytic clathrin adaptor {AP}-2.},

To investigate this, we used single-cell {RNA} sequencing to quantify transcript heterogeneity in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We also discovered that a subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or {MAP} kinase Hog1, revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.},

There has been considerable interest in the identification of small molecule inhibitors of aquaporins, with various candidates emerging from testing of known ion transport inhibitors, as well as compound screening and computational chemistry. However, in general, the activity of reported aquaporin inhibitors has not been confirmed on retesting, which may be due to technical problems in water transport assays used in the original identification studies, and the challenges in modulating the activity of small, compact, pore-containing membrane proteins. We review here the state of the field of aquaporin-modulating small molecules and biologics, and the challenges and opportunities in moving forward.},

We applied {viscRNA}-Seq to monitor dengue and Zika virus infection in cultured cells and discovered extreme heterogeneity in virus abundance.

	abstract = {Neutralizing antibodies ({NAbs}) can be both sufficient and necessary for protection against viral infections, although they sometimes act in concert with cellular immunity. Successful vaccines against viruses induce {NAbs} but vaccine candidates against some major viral pathogens, including {HIV}-1, have failed to induce potent and effective such responses. Theories of how antibodies neutralize virus infectivity have been formulated and experimentally tested since the 1930s; and controversies about the mechanistic and quantitative bases for neutralization have continually arisen. Soluble versions of native oligomeric viral proteins that mimic the functional targets of neutralizing antibodies now allow the measurement of the relevant affinities of {NAbs}. Thereby the neutralizing occupancies on virions can be estimated and related to the potency of the {NAbs}. Furthermore, the kinetics and stoichiometry of {NAb} binding can be compared with neutralizing efficacy. Recently, the fundamental discovery that the intracellular factor {TRIM}21 determines the degree of neutralization of adenovirus has provided new mechanistic and quantitative insights. Since {TRIM}21 resides in the cytoplasm, it would not affect the neutralization of enveloped viruses, but its range of activity against naked viruses will be important to uncover. These developments bring together the old problems of virus neutralization-mechanism, stoichiometry, kinetics, and efficacy-from surprising new angles.},

Our results also show that {VLP} production was abolished by amino acid substitution of the Gag N-terminal myristoylglycine and impaired when Gag C-terminal deletions were extended beyond the nucleocapsid domain. These results were consistent with those obtained previously in higher eukaryotic expression systems, suggesting that similar Gag domains were used for {VLP} assembly.

	abstract = {Viral protein R (Vpr) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 induces G2 arrest in cells from distantly related eukaryotes including human and fission yeast through inhibitory phosphorylation of tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) on Cdc2. Since the {DNA} damage and {DNA} replication checkpoints also induce G2 arrest through phosphorylation of Tyr15, it seemed possible that Vpr induces G2 arrest through the checkpoint pathways. However, Vpr does not use either the early or the late checkpoint genes that are required for G2 arrest in response to {DNA} damage or inhibition of {DNA} synthesis indicating that Vpr induces G2 arrest by an alternative pathway. It was found that protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) plays an important role in the induction of G2 arrest by Vpr since mutations in genes coding for a regulatory or catalytic subunit of {PP}2A reduce Vpr-induced G2 arrest. Vpr was also found to upregulate {PP}2A, supporting a model in which Vpr activates the {PP}2A holoenzyme to induce G2 arrest. {PP}2A is known to interact genetically in fission yeast with the Wee1 kinase and Cdc25 phosphatase that act on Tyr15 of Cdc2. Both Wee1 and Cdc25 play a role in Vpr-induced G2 arrest since a wee1 deletion reduces Vpr-induced G2 arrest and a direct in vivo assay shows that Vpr inhibits Cdc25. Additional support for both Wee1 and Cdc25 playing a role in Vpr-induced G2 arrest comes from a genetic screen, which identified genes whose overexpression affects Vpr-induced G2 arrest. For this genetic screen, a strain was constructed in which cell killing by Vpr was nearly eliminated while the effect of Vpr on the cell cycle was clearly indicated by an increase in cell length. Overexpression of the wos2 gene, an inhibitor of Wee1, suppresses Vpr-induced G2 arrest while overexpression of rad25, an inhibitor of Cdc25, enhances Vpr-induced G2 arrest. These two genes may be part of the uncharacterized pathway for Vpr-induced G2 arrest in which Vpr upregulates {PP}2A to activate Wee1 and inhibit Cdc25. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.},

La-related protein-4 ({LARP}4) binds poly(A) and {PABP}. {LARP}4 {mRNA} contains a translation-dependent, coding region determinant ({CRD}) of instability that limits its expression. Although the {CRD} comprises {\textbackslash}textless 10\% of {LARP}4 codons, the {mRNA} levels vary {\textbackslash}textgreater20 fold with synonymous {CRD} substitutions that accommodate {tRNA} dynamics. Separately, overexpression of the most limiting {tRNA} increases {LARP}4 levels and reveals its functional activity, net lengthening of the {PATs} of heterologous {mRNAs} with concomitant stabilization, including ribosomal protein ({RP}) {mRNAs}. Genetic deletion of cellular {LARP}4 decreases {PAT} length and {RPmRNA} stability. This {LARP}4 activity requires its {PABP}-interaction domain and the {RNA}-binding module which we show is sensitive to poly(A) 3'-termini, consistent with protection from deadenylation. The results indicate that {LARP}4 is a posttranscriptional regulator of ribosomal protein production in mammalian cells and suggest that this activity can be controlled by {tRNA} levels.},

However, how {DR} limits cancer progression remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that feeding mice a low-protein (Low {PROT}) isocaloric diet but not a low-carbohydrate (Low {CHO}) diet reduced tumor growth in three independent mouse cancer models. Surprisingly, this effect relies on anticancer immunosurveillance, as depleting {CD}8+ T cells, antigen-presenting cells ({APCs}), or using immunodeficient mice prevented the beneficial effect of the diet. Mechanistically, we established that a Low {PROT} diet induces the unfolded protein response ({UPR}) in tumor cells through the activation of {IRE}1{\textbackslash}alpha and {RIG}1 signaling, thereby resulting in cytokine production and mounting an efficient anticancer immune response. Collectively, our data suggest that a Low {PROT} diet induces an {IRE}1{\textbackslash}alpha-dependent {UPR} in cancer cells, enhancing a {CD}8-mediated T cell response against tumors.

We also show that cytoplasmic, but not nuclear La, engages poly(A) {RNA} in human cells, that La entry into polysomes utilizes the poly(A) binding mode, and that La promotion of translation from the cyclin D1 internal ribosome entry site occurs in competition with cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein ({PABP}).

	abstract = {During an immune response, activated B cells may undergo class switch recombination ({CSR}), a molecular rearrangement that allows B cells to switch from expressing {IgM} and {IgD} to a secondary antibody heavy chain isotype such as {IgG}, {IgA} or {IgE}. Secondary antibody isotypes provide the adaptive immune system with distinct effector functions to optimally combat various pathogens. {CSR} occurs between repetitive {DNA} elements within the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus, termed switch (S) regions and requires the {DNA}-modifying enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase ({AID}). {AID}-mediated {DNA} deamination within S regions initiates the formation of {DNA} double-strand breaks, which serve as biochemical beacons for downstream {DNA} repair pathways that coordinate the ligation of {DNA} breaks. Myriad factors contribute to optimal {AID} targeting; however, many of these factors also localize to genomic regions outside of the Igh locus. Thus, a current challenge is to explain the specific targeting of {AID} to the Igh locus. Recent studies have implicated noncoding {RNAs} in {CSR}, suggesting a provocative mechanism that incorporates Igh-specific factors to enable precise {AID} targeting. Here, we chronologically recount the rich history of noncoding {RNAs} functioning in {CSR} to provide a comprehensive context for recent and future discoveries. We present a model for the {RNA}-guided targeting of {AID} that attempts to integrate historical and recent findings, and highlight potential caveats. Lastly, we discuss testable hypotheses ripe for current experimentation, and explore promising ideas for future investigations. {\textbackslash}copyright The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2017.

	abstract = {Interactions among mutations within a protein have the potential to make molecular evolution contingent and irreversible, but the extent to which epistasis actually shaped historical evolutionary trajectories is unclear. To address this question, we experimentally measured how the fitness effects of historical sequence substitutions changed during the billion-year evolutionary history of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) {ATPase} domain beginning from a deep eukaryotic ancestor to modern Saccharomyces cerevisiae We found a pervasive influence of epistasis. Of 98 derived amino acid states that evolved along this lineage, about half compromise fitness when introduced into the reconstructed ancestral Hsp90. And the vast majority of ancestral states reduce fitness when introduced into the extant S. cerevisiae Hsp90. Overall, more than 75\% of historical substitutions were contingent on permissive substitutions that rendered the derived state nondeleterious, became entrenched by subsequent restrictive substitutions that made the ancestral state deleterious, or both. This epistasis was primarily caused by specific interactions among sites rather than a general effect on the protein's tolerance to mutation. Our results show that epistasis continually opened and closed windows of mutational opportunity over evolutionary timescales, producing histories and biological states that reflect the transient internal constraints imposed by the protein's fleeting sequence states.},

We show that one night of sleep deprivation, relative to baseline, resulted in a significant increase in A{\textbackslash}beta burden in the right hippocampus and thalamus. These increases were associated with mood worsening following sleep deprivation, but were not related to the genetic risk ({APOE} genotype) for Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, baseline {ABB} in a range of subcortical regions and the precuneus was inversely associated with reported night sleep hours. {APOE} genotyping was also linked to subcortical {ABB}, suggesting that different Alzheimer's disease risk factors might independently affect {ABB} in nearby brain regions.

The inferred map recapitulates most if not all developmental relationships and associates new regulators and marker genes with each cell state. We find that many embryonic cell states appear earlier than previously appreciated. We also assess conflicting models of neural crest development. Incorporating a matched time series of zebrafish development from a companion paper, we reveal conserved and divergent features of vertebrate early developmental gene expression programs.

To uncover these transcriptional trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis, we sequenced 38,731 cells and developed {URD}, a simulated diffusion-based computational reconstruction method. {URD} identified the trajectories of 25 cell types through early somitogenesis, gene expression along them, and their spatial origin in the blastula. Analysis of Nodal signaling mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a subset of wild-type transcriptional trajectories. Some wild-type developmental branch points contained cells that express genes characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings reconstruct the transcriptional trajectories of a vertebrate embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trees from single-cell transcriptomes.

However, {DNA} synthesis and sequencing errors confound the correct interpretation of observed barcodes and can lead to significant data loss or spurious results. Widely-used error-correcting codes borrowed from computer science (e.g., Hamming and Levenshtein codes) do not properly account for insertions and deletions in {DNA} barcodes, even though deletions are the most common type of synthesis error. Here, we present and experimentally validate {FREE} (Filled/truncated Right End Edit) barcodes, which correct substitution, insertion, and deletion errors, even when these errors alter the barcode length. {FREE} barcodes are designed with experimental considerations in mind, including balanced {GC} content, minimal homopolymer runs, and reduced internal hairpin propensity. We generate and include lists of barcodes with different lengths and error-correction levels that may be useful in diverse high-throughput applications, including {\textbackslash}textgreater10{\textasciicircum}6 single-error correcting 16-mers that strike a balance between decoding accuracy, barcode length, and library size. Moreover, concatenating two or more {FREE} codes into a single barcode increases the available barcode space combinatorially, generating lists with {\textbackslash}textgreater10{\textasciicircum}15 error-correcting barcodes. The included software for creating barcode libraries and decoding sequenced barcodes is efficient and designed to be user-friendly for the general biology community.},

These Ab diversification processes are initiated by the deaminating enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase followed by many {DNA} repair enzymes, ultimately leading to deletions and a high mutation rate in the Ab genes, whereas {DNA} lesions made by activation-induced cytidine deaminase are repaired with low error rate on most other genes. This indicates an advanced regulation of {DNA} repair. In this study, we show that initiation of Ab diversification in B lymphocytes of mouse spleen leads to formation of a complex between many proteins in {DNA} repair. We show also that {BCR} activation, which signals the end of successful {SH}, reduces interactions between some proteins in the complex and increases other interactions in the complex with varying kinetics. Furthermore, we show increased localization of {SH}- and {CSR}-coupled proteins on switch regions of the Igh locus upon initiation of {SH}/{CSR} and differential changes in the localization upon {BCR} signaling, which terminates {SH}. These findings provide early evidence for a {DNA} repair complex or complexes that may be of functional significance for carrying out essential roles in {SH} and/or {CSR} in B cells.

While these often occur co-transcriptionally between nascent {RNA} and template {DNA}, we now show that they also form as part of a post-transcriptional mechanism targeting {AID} to {IgH} S-regions. This depends on the {RNA} helicase {DDX}1 that is also required for {CSR} in vivo. {DDX}1 binds to G-quadruplex (G4) structures present in intronic switch transcripts and converts them into S-region R-loops. This in turn targets the cytidine deaminase enzyme {AID} to S-regions so promoting {CSR}. Notably R-loop levels over S-regions are diminished by chemical stabilization of G4 {RNA} or by the expression of a {DDX}1 {ATPase}-deficient mutant that acts as a dominant-negative protein to reduce {CSR} efficiency. In effect, we provide evidence for how S-region transcripts interconvert between G4 and R-loop structures to promote {CSR} in the {IgH} locus. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2018 The Author(s).

However, overcoming the rate-limiting step of endosomal escape into the cytoplasm remains a major challenge. Hydrophobic amino acid R groups are known to play a vital role in viral escape from endosomes. Here we utilize a real-time, quantitative live cell split-{GFP} fluorescence complementation phenotypic assay to systematically analyze and optimize a series of synthetic endosomal escape domains ({EEDs}). By conjugating {EEDs} to a {TAT}-{PTD}/{CPP} spilt-{GFP} peptide complementation assay, we were able to quantitatively measure endosomal escape into the cytoplasm of live cells via restoration of {GFP} fluorescence by intracellular molecular complementation. We found that {EEDs} containing two aromatic indole rings or one indole ring and two aromatic phenyl groups at a fixed distance of six polyethylene glycol ({PEG}) units from the {TAT}-{PTD}-cargo significantly enhanced cytoplasmic delivery in the absence of cytotoxicity. {EEDs} address the critical rate-limiting step of endosomal escape in delivery of macromolecular biologic peptide, protein and {siRNA} therapeutics into cells.},

Uptake occurs through both endocytotic and nonendocytotic pathways, but the molecular requirements for efficient internalization are not fully understood. Here we investigate how the presence of tryptophans and their position within an oligoarginine influence uptake mechanism and efficiency. Flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence imaging are used to estimate uptake efficiency, intracellular distribution and toxicity in Chinese hamster ovarian cells. Further, membrane leakage and lipid membrane affinity are investigated. The peptides contain eight arginine residues and one to four tryptophans, the tryptophans positioned either at the N-terminus, in the middle, or evenly distributed along the amino acid sequence. Our data show that the intracellular distribution varies among peptides with different tryptophan content and backbone spacing. Uptake efficiency is higher for the peptides with four tryptophans in the middle, or evenly distributed along the peptide sequence, than for the peptide with four tryptophans at the N-terminus. All peptides display low cytotoxicity except for the one with four tryptophans at the N-terminus, which was moderately toxic. This finding is consistent with their inability to induce efficient leakage of dye from lipid vesicles. All peptides have comparable affinities for lipid vesicles, showing that lipid binding is not a decisive parameter for uptake. Our results indicate that tryptophan content and backbone spacing can affect both the {CPP} uptake efficiency and the {CPP} uptake mechanism. The low cytotoxicity of these peptides and the possibilities of tuning their uptake mechanism are interesting from a therapeutic point of view.},

However, how much the plasma proteome varies with time of day and is regulated by the master circadian suprachiasmatic nucleus brain clock, assessed here by the melatonin rhythm, is largely unknown. Here, we assessed 24-h time-of-day patterns of human plasma proteins in six healthy men during daytime food intake and nighttime sleep in phase with the endogenous circadian clock (i.e., circadian alignment) versus daytime sleep and nighttime food intake out of phase with the endogenous circadian clock (i.e., circadian misalignment induced by simulated nightshift work). We identified 24-h time-of-day patterns in 573 of 1,129 proteins analyzed, with 30 proteins showing strong regulation by the circadian cycle. Relative to circadian alignment, the average abundance and/or 24-h time-of-day patterns of 127 proteins were altered during circadian misalignment. Altered proteins were associated with biological pathways involved in immune function, metabolism, and cancer. Of the 30 circadian-regulated proteins, the majority peaked between 1400 hours and 2100 hours, and these 30 proteins were associated with basic pathways involved in extracellular matrix organization, tyrosine kinase signaling, and signaling by receptor tyrosine-protein kinase {erbB}-2. Furthermore, circadian misalignment altered multiple proteins known to regulate glucose homeostasis and/or energy metabolism, with implications for altered metabolic physiology. Our findings demonstrate the circadian clock, the behavioral wake-sleep/food intake-fasting cycle, and interactions between these processes regulate 24-h time-of-day patterns of human plasma proteins and help identify mechanisms of circadian misalignment that may contribute to metabolic dysregulation.},

But because viruses often infect multiple hosts and the numbers of distinct lineages within a host can be vast, their delineation into species is often dictated by arbitrary sequence thresholds, which are highly inconsistent across lineages. Here we apply an approach to determine the boundaries of viral species based on the detection of gene flow within populations, thereby defining viral species according to the biological species concept ({BSC}). Despite the potential for gene transfer between highly divergent genomes, viruses, like the cellular organisms they infect, assort into reproductively isolated groups and can be organized into biological species. This approach revealed that {BSC}-defined viral species are often congruent with the taxonomic partitioning based on shared gene contents and host tropism, and that bacteriophages can similarly be classified in biological species. These results open the possibility to use a single, universal definition of species that is applicable across cellular and acellular lifeforms.},

	abstract = {Short-interfering {RNA} ({siRNA})-induced {RNAi} responses have great potential to treat a wide variety of human diseases from cancer to pandemic viral outbreaks to Parkinson's Disease. However, before {siRNAs} can become drugs, they must overcome a billion years of evolutionary defenses designed to keep invading {RNAs} on the outside cells from getting to the inside of cells. Not surprisingly, significant effort has been placed in developing a wide array of delivery technologies. Foremost of these has been the development of N-acetylgalactosamine ({GalNAc}) {siRNA} conjugates for delivery to liver. Tris-{GalNAc} binds to the Asialoglycoprotein receptor that is highly expressed on hepatocytes resulting in rapid endocytosis. While the exact mechanism of escape across the endosomal lipid bilayer membrane remains unknown, sufficient amounts of {siRNAs} enter the cytoplasm to induce robust, target selective {RNAi} responses in vivo. Multiple {GalNAc}-{siRNA} conjugate clinical trials, including two phase {III} trials, are currently underway by three biotech companies to treat a wide variety of diseases. {GalNAc}-{siRNA} conjugates are a simple solution to the {siRNA} delivery problem for liver hepatocytes and have shown the {RNAi} (and antisense oligonucleotide) field the path forward for targeting other tissue types.},

In particular, a specific neuropeptide, which we call {NDA}-1, contributes to the reduction of Gram-positive bacteria during early development and thus to a spatial distribution of the main colonizer, the Gram-negative Curvibacter sp., along the body axis. Our findings warrant further research to test whether neuropeptides secreted by nerve cells contribute to the spatial structure of microbial communities in other organisms.Certain neuropeptides, in addition to their neuromodulatory functions, display antibacterial activities of unclear significance.

	abstract = {The transplantation of stem cells and viruses in utero has tremendous potential for treating congenital disorders in the human fetus. For example, in utero transplantation ({IUT}) of hematopoietic stem cells has been used to successfully treat patients with severe combined immunodeficiency. In several other conditions, however, {IUT} has been attempted without success. Given these mixed results, the availability of an efficient non-human model to study the biological sequelae of stem cell transplantation and gene therapy is critical to advance this field. We and others have used the mouse model of {IUT} to study factors affecting successful engraftment of in utero transplanted hematopoietic stem cells in both wild-type mice and those with genetic diseases. The fetal environment also offers considerable advantages for the success of in utero gene therapy. For example, the delivery of adenoviral, adeno-associated viral, retroviral, and lentiviral vectors into the fetus has resulted in the transduction of multiple organs distant from the site of injection with long-term gene expression. in utero gene therapy may therefore be considered as a possible treatment strategy for single gene disorders such as muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis. Another potential advantage of {IUT} is the ability to induce immune tolerance to a specific antigen. As seen in mice with hemophilia, the introduction of Factor {IX} early in development results in tolerance to this protein. In addition to its use in investigating potential human therapies, the mouse model of {IUT} can be a powerful tool to study basic questions in developmental and stem cell biology. For example, one can deliver various small molecules to induce or inhibit specific gene expression at defined gestational stages and manipulate developmental pathways. The impact of these alterations can be assessed at various timepoints after the initial transplantation. Furthermore, one can transplant pluripotent or lineage specific progenitor cells into the fetal environment to study stem cell differentiation in a non-irradiated and unperturbed host environment. The mouse model of {IUT} has already provided numerous insights within the fields of immunology, and developmental and stem cell biology. In this video-based protocol, we describe a step-by-step approach to performing {IUT} in mouse fetuses and outline the critical steps and potential pitfalls of this technique.},

Ultrasound, the current gold standard, is not always affordable in low-resource settings and does not predict spontaneous preterm birth, a leading cause of infant death. In a pilot study of 31 healthy pregnant women, we found that measurement of nine cell-free {RNA} ({cfRNA}) transcripts in maternal blood predicted gestational age with comparable accuracy to ultrasound but at substantially lower cost. In a related study of 38 women (23 full-term and 15 preterm deliveries), all at elevated risk of delivering preterm, we identified seven {cfRNA} transcripts that accurately classified women who delivered preterm up to 2 months in advance of labor. These tests hold promise for prenatal care in both the developed and developing worlds, although they require validation in larger, blinded clinical trials.

Direct reprogramming relies on the implementation of a new transcriptional program defining the desired neuronal identity in fully differentiated glial cells implying the more or less complete down-regulation of the program for the former identity of the glial cell. Despite the enormous progress achieved in this regard with highly efficient in vivo reprogramming after injury, a number of hurdles still need to be resolved. One way to further improve direct neuronal reprogramming is to understand the molecular hurdles which we discuss with the focus on chromatin states of the starting versus the reprogrammed cells.

	abstract = {{HIV}-1 infection is associated with increased risk for B-cell lymphomas. How {HIV} infection promotes the development of lymphoma is unclear, but it may involve chronic B-cell activation, inflammation, and/or impaired immunity, possibly leading to a loss of control of oncogenic viruses and reduced tumor immunosurveillance. We hypothesized that {HIV} structural proteins may contribute to lymphomagenesis directly, because they can persist long term in lymph nodes in the absence of viral replication. The {HIV}-1 transgenic mouse Tg26 carries a noninfectious {HIV}-1 provirus lacking part of the gag-pol region, thus constituting a model for studying the effects of viral products in pathogenesis. Approximately 15\% of Tg26 mice spontaneously develop leukemia/lymphoma. We investigated which viral proteins are associated with the development of leukemia/lymphoma in the Tg26 mouse model, and performed microarray analysis on {RNA} from spleen and lymph nodes to identify potential mechanisms of lymphomagenesis. Of the viral proteins examined, only expression of {HIV}-1 matrix protein p17 was associated with leukemia/lymphoma development and was highly expressed in bone marrow before disease. The tumor cells resembled pro-B cells, and were {CD}19+{IgM}-{IgD}-{CD}93+{CD}43+{CD}21-{CD}23-{VpreB}+{CXCR}4+ Consistent with the pro-B-cell stage of B-cell development, microarray analysis revealed enrichment of transcripts, including Rag1, Rag2, {CD}93, Vpreb1, Vpreb3, and Igll1 We confirmed {RAG}1 expression in Tg26 tumors, and hypothesized that {HIV}-1 matrix protein p17 may directly induce {RAG}1 in B cells.

	abstract = {Recent evidences suggest that human gut microbiota with major component as bacteria can induce immunity. It is also known that gut lining depletes with ageing and that there is increased risk of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders with ageing. It is therefore likely that both may be correlated as depletion of gut lining exposes the gut bacterial antigens to host immune mechanisms, which may induce immunity to certain bacterial proteins, but at the same time such immunity may also be auto-immunogenic to host. This autoimmunity may make a protein molecule nonfunctional and thereby may be involved in late onset metabolic, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders such as, Diabetes, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Hyperlipidemias and Cancer. In this in-silico study we found a large number of peptides identical between human and gut bacteria which were binding to {HLA}-{II} alleles, and hence, likely to be auto-immunogenic. Further we observed that such autoimmune candidates were enriched in bacterial species belonging to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla, which lead us to conclude that these phyla may have higher disease impact in genetically predisposed individuals. Functional annotation of human proteins homologous to candidate gut-bacterial peptides showed significant enrichment in metabolic processes and pathways. Cognitive trait, Ageing, Alzheimer, Type 2 diabetes, Chronic Kidney Failure ({CKF}), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ({COPD}) and various Cancers were the major diseases represented in the dataset. This dataset provides us with gut bacterial autoimmune candidates which can be studied for their clinical significance in late onset diseases.},

	abstract = {The microbial ecosystem that inhabits the gastrointestinal tract of all mammals-the gut microbiota-has been in a symbiotic relationship with its hosts over many millennia. Thanks to modern technology, the myriad of functions that are controlled or modulated by the gut microbiota are beginning to unfold. One of the systems that is emerging to closely interact with the gut microbiota is the body's major neuroendocrine system that controls various body processes in response to stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis. This interaction is of pivotal importance; as various disorders of the microbiota-gut-brain axis are associated with dysregulation of the {HPA} axis. The present contribution describes the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the {HPA} axis and delineates the potential underlying mechanisms. In this regard, it is important to note that the communication between the gut microbiota and the {HPA} axis is closely interrelated with other systems, such as the immune system, the intestinal barrier and blood-brain barrier, microbial metabolites, and gut hormones, as well as the sensory and autonomic nervous systems. These communication pathways will be exemplified through preclinical models of early life stress, beneficial roles of probiotics and prebiotics, evidence from germ-free mice, and antibiotic-induced modulation of the gut microbiota.},

Previous data indicated that immunoglobulins (Igs) or autoantibodies (auto-Abs) reactive with {\textbackslash}alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ({\textbackslash}alpha-{MSH}) are involved in regulation of feeding and emotion; however, the origin of such auto-Abs is unknown. Here, using proteomics, we identified {ClpB} heat-shock disaggregation chaperone protein of commensal gut bacteria Escherichia coli as a conformational antigen mimetic of {\textbackslash}alpha-{MSH}. We show that {ClpB}-immunized mice produce anti-{ClpB} {IgG} crossreactive with {\textbackslash}alpha-{MSH}, influencing food intake, body weight, anxiety and melanocortin receptor 4 signaling. Furthermore, chronic intragastric delivery of E. coli in mice decreased food intake and stimulated formation of {ClpB}- and {\textbackslash}alpha-{MSH}-reactive antibodies, while {ClpB}-deficient E. coli did not affect food intake or antibody levels. Finally, we show that plasma levels of anti-{ClpB} {IgG} crossreactive with {\textbackslash}alpha-{MSH} are increased in patients with {AN}, bulimia and {BED}, and that the {ED} Inventory-2 scores in {ED} patients correlate with anti-{ClpB} {IgG} and {IgM}, which is similar to our previous findings for {\textbackslash}alpha-{MSH} auto-Abs. In conclusion, this work shows that the bacterial {ClpB} protein, which is present in several commensal and pathogenic microorganisms, can be responsible for the production of auto-Abs crossreactive with {\textbackslash}alpha-{MSH}, associated with altered feeding and emotion in humans with {ED}.

	abstract = {Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) enables the quantification of each gene's expression distribution across cells, thus allowing the assessment of the dispersion, nonzero fraction, and other aspects of its distribution beyond the mean. These statistical characterizations of the gene expression distribution are critical for understanding expression variation and for selecting marker genes for population heterogeneity. However, {scRNA}-seq data are noisy, with each cell typically sequenced at low coverage, thus making it difficult to infer properties of the gene expression distribution from raw counts. Based on a reexamination of nine public datasets, we propose a simple technical noise model for {scRNA}-seq data with unique molecular identifiers ({UMI}). We develop deconvolution of single-cell expression distribution ({DESCEND}), a method that deconvolves the true cross-cell gene expression distribution from observed {scRNA}-seq counts, leading to improved estimates of properties of the distribution such as dispersion and nonzero fraction. {DESCEND} can adjust for cell-level covariates such as cell size, cell cycle, and batch effects. {DESCEND}'s noise model and estimation accuracy are further evaluated through comparisons to {RNA} {FISH} data, through data splitting and simulations and through its effectiveness in removing known batch effects. We demonstrate how {DESCEND} can clarify and improve downstream analyses such as finding differentially expressed genes, identifying cell types, and selecting differentiation markers.

The inherent monospecificity of {mAbs} present limitations to {mAb} therapy which have become apparent notably in addressing complex entities like infectious agents or heterogenic endogenous targets. For such indications mixtures of antibodies comprising a combination of specificities would convey more potent biological effect which could translate into therapeutic efficacy. Recombinant polyclonal antibodies ({rpAb}) consisting of a defined number of well-characterized {mAbs} constitute a new class of target specific antibody therapy. We have developed a cost-efficient cell banking and single-batch manufacturing concept for the production of such products and demonstrate that a complex {pAb} composition, rozrolimupab, comprising 25 individual antibodies can be manufactured in a highly consistent manner in a scaled-up manufacturing process. We present a strategy for the release and characterization of antibody mixtures which constitute a complete series of chemistry, manufacturing, and control ({CMC}) analytical methods to address identity, purity, quantity, potency, and general characteristics. Finally we document selected quality attributes of rozrolimupab based on a battery of assays at the genetic-, protein-, and functional level and demonstrate that the manufactured rozrolimupab batches are highly pure and very uniform in their composition.

	abstract = {Post-translational modifications hugely increase the functional diversity of proteomes. Recent algorithms based on ultratolerant database searching are forging a path to unbiased analysis of peptide modifications by shotgun mass spectrometry. However, these approaches identify only one-half of the modified forms potentially detectable and do not map the modified residue. Moreover, tools for the quantitative analysis of peptide modifications are currently lacking. Here, we present a suite of algorithms that allows comprehensive identification of detectable modifications, pinpoints the modified residues, and enables their quantitative analysis through an integrated statistical model. These developments were used to characterize the impact of mitochondrial heteroplasmy on the proteome and on the modified peptidome in several tissues from 12-week-old mice. Our results reveal that heteroplasmy mainly affects cardiac tissue, inducing oxidative damage to proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation system, and provide a molecular mechanism explaining the structural and functional alterations produced in heart mitochondria.

	abstract = {Open modification search ({OMS}) is a powerful search strategy that identifies peptides carrying any type of modification by allowing a modified spectrum to match against its unmodified variant by using a very wide precursor mass window. A drawback of this strategy, however, is that it leads to a large increase in search time. Although performing an open search can be done using existing spectral library search engines by simply setting a wide precursor mass window, none of these tools have been optimized for {OMS}, leading to excessive runtimes and suboptimal identification results. Here we present the {ANN}-{SoLo} tool for fast and accurate open spectral library searching. {ANN}-{SoLo} uses approximate nearest neighbor indexing to speed up {OMS} by selecting only a limited number of the most relevant library spectra to compare to an unknown query spectrum. This approach is combined with a cascade search strategy to maximize the number of identified unmodified and modified spectra while strictly controlling the false discovery rate, as well as a shifted dot product score to sensitively match modified spectra to their unmodified counterparts. {ANN}-{SoLo} outperforms the state-of-the-art {SpectraST} spectral library search engine both in terms of speed and the number of identifications. On a previously published human cell line data set, {ANN}-{SoLo} confidently identifies 40\% more spectra than {SpectraST} while achieving a speedup of an order of magnitude. {ANN}-{SoLo} is implemented in Python and C++.

	abstract = {Chemical reprogramming provides a powerful platform for exploring the molecular dynamics that lead to pluripotency. Although previous studies have uncovered an intermediate extraembryonic endoderm ({XEN})-like state during this process, the molecular underpinnings of pluripotency acquisition remain largely undefined. Here, we profile 36,199 single-cell transcriptomes at multiple time points throughout a highly efficient chemical reprogramming system using {RNA}-sequencing and reconstruct their progression trajectories. Through identifying sequential molecular events, we reveal that the dynamic early embryonic-like programs are key aspects of successful reprogramming from {XEN}-like state to pluripotency, including the concomitant transcriptomic signatures of two-cell (2C) embryonic-like and early pluripotency programs and the epigenetic signature of notable genome-wide {DNA} demethylation. Moreover, via enhancing the 2C-like program by fine-tuning chemical treatment, the reprogramming process is remarkably accelerated. Collectively, our findings offer a high-resolution dissection of cell fate dynamics during chemical reprogramming and shed light on mechanistic insights into the nature of induced pluripotency.

	abstract = {Single-cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. Because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. However, some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, population balance analysis ({PBA}), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high-dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of {PBA}, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells ({HPCs}). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with {HPC} fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.

	abstract = {Modern dogs are distinguished among domesticated species by the vast breadth of phenotypic variation produced by strong and consistent human-driven selective pressure. The resulting breeds reflect the development of closed populations with well-defined physical and behavioral attributes. The sport-hunting dog group has long been employed in assistance to hunters, reflecting strong behavioral pressures to locate and pursue quarry over great distances and variable terrain. Comparison of whole-genome sequence data between sport-hunting and terrier breeds, groups at the ends of a continuum in both form and function, reveals that genes underlying cardiovascular, muscular, and neuronal functions are under strong selection in sport-hunting breeds, including {ADRB}1, {TRPM}3, {RYR}3, {UTRN}, {ASIC}3, and {ROBO}1 We also identified an allele of {TRPM}3 that was significantly associated with increased racing speed in Whippets, accounting for 11.6\% of the total variance in racing performance. Finally, we observed a significant association of {ROBO}1 with breed-specific accomplishments in competitive obstacle course events. These results provide strong evidence that sport-hunting breeds have been adapted to their occupations by improved endurance, cardiac function, blood flow, and cognitive performance, demonstrating how strong behavioral selection alters physiology to create breeds with distinct capabilities.

	abstract = {In order to investigate the role of {microRNAs} in the pathogenesis of different B-cell lymhoma subtypes, we have applied an array-based assay to a series of 76 mixed non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas, including Burkitt's lymphoma ({BL}), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma ({MCL}) and follicular lymphoma. Lymphomas clustered according to histological subtypes, driven by two {miRNA} clusters (the {miR}-29 family and the {miR}-17-92 cluster). Since the two {miRNA} clusters are known to be {MYC}-regulated, we investigated whether this would be supported in {MYC}-driven experimental models, and found that this signature separated {BL} cell lines and a {MYC}-translocated {MCL} cell lines from normal germinal center B-cells and other B-cell populations. Similar results were also reproduced in tissue samples comparing {BL} and reactive lymph node samples. The same series was then quantitatively analyzed for {MYC} expression by immunohistochemistry and {MYC} protein levels were compared with corresponding {miRNA} signatures. A specific metric was developed to summarize the levels of {MYC}-related {microRNAs} and the corresponding protein levels. We found that {MYC}-related signatures are directly related to {MYC} protein expression across the whole spectrum of B-cells and B-cell lymphoma, suggesting that the {MYC}-responsive machinery shows predominantly quantitative, rather than qualitative, modifications in B-cell lymphoma. Novel {MYC}-related {miRNAs} were also discovered by this approach. Finally, network analysis found that in {BL} {MYC}-related differentially expressed {miRNAs} could control, either positively or negatively, a limited number of hub proteins, including {BCL}2, {CDK}6, {MYB}, {ZEB}1, {CTNNB}1, {BAX} and {XBP}1.},

To date, clinical trials of one family member, brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF}), have disappointingly failed to meet desired endpoints. Contributing to these failures is the fact that {BDNF} is pharmaceutically a nonideal biologic drug candidate. It is a highly charged, yet is a net hydrophobic molecule with a low molecular weight that confers a short t1/2 in man. To circumvent these shortcomings of {BDNF} as a drug candidate, we have employed a function-based cellular screening assay to select activating antibodies of the {BDNF} receptor {TrkB} from a combinatorial human short-chain variable fragment antibody library. We report here the successful selection of several potent {TrkB} agonist antibodies and detailed biochemical and physiological characterization of one such antibody, {ZEB}85. By using a human {TrkB} reporter cell line and {BDNF}-responsive {GABAergic} neurons derived from human {ES} cells, we demonstrate that {ZEB}85 is a full agonist of {TrkB}, comparable in potency to {BDNF} toward human neurons in activation of {TrkB} phosphorylation, canonical signal transduction, and {mRNA} transcriptional regulation.

Little is known about how global metabolism supports naive B cell activation to enable an effective immune response.

Isotopomer tracing uncovered increases in {TCA} cycle intermediates with almost no contribution from glucose. Instead, glucose mainly supported the biosynthesis of ribonucleotides. Glucose restriction did not affect B cell functions, yet the inhibition of {OXPHOS} or glutamine restriction markedly impaired B cell growth and differentiation. Increased {OXPHOS} prompted studies of mitochondrial dynamics, which revealed extensive mitochondria remodeling during activation. Our results show how B cell metabolism adapts with stimulation and reveals unexpected details for carbon utilization and mitochondrial dynamics at the start of a humoral immune response.

	abstract = {T cell receptors ({TCRs}) bind to peptide-major histocompatibility complex ({pMHC}) with low affinity (Kd ∼ μM), which is generally assumed to facilitate cross-reactive {TCR} "scanning" of ligands. To understand the relationship between {TCR}/{pMHC} affinity and cross-reactivity, we sought to engineer an additional weak interaction, termed "velcro," between the {TCR} and {pMHC} to probe the specificities of {TCRs} at relatively low and high affinities. This additional interaction was generated through an eight-amino acid peptide library covalently linked to the N terminus of the {MHC}-bound peptide. Velcro was selected through an affinity-based isolation and was subsequently shown to enhance the cognate {TCR}/{pMHC} affinity in a peptide-dependent manner by ∼10-fold. This was sufficient to convert a nonstimulatory ultra-low-affinity ligand into a stimulatory ligand. An X-ray crystallographic structure revealed how velcro interacts with the {TCR}. To probe {TCR} cross-reactivity, we screened {TCRs} against yeast-displayed {pMHC} libraries with and without velcro, and found that the peptide cross-reactivity profiles of low-affinity (Kd {\textbackslash}textgreater 100 μM) and high-affinity (Kd ∼ μM) {TCR}/{pMHC} interactions are remarkably similar. The conservation of recognition of the {TCR} for {pMHC} across affinities reveals the nature of low-affinity ligands for which there are important biological functions and has implications for understanding the specificities of affinity-matured {TCRs}.},

Here, we (1) characterize the distribution of the {CLRT} statistic (Lambda) as a function of the population recombination rate (R=4Ner); (2) explore the effects of bias in estimation of R on the size (type I error) of the {CLRT}; (3) explore the robustness of the model to population growth, bottlenecks, and migration; (4) explore the power of the {CLRT} under varying levels of mutation, selection, and recombination; (5) explore the discriminatory power of the test in distinguishing negative selection from population growth; and (6) evaluate the performance of maximum composite-likelihood estimation ({MCLE}) of the selection coefficient. We find that the test has excellent power to detect weak negative selection and moderate power to detect positive selection. Moreover, the test is quite robust to bias in the estimate of local recombination rate, but not to certain demographic scenarios such as population growth or a recent bottleneck. Last, we demonstrate that the {MCLE} of the selection parameter has little bias for weak negative selection and has downward bias for positively selected mutations.},

Single-cell {RNA} sequencing can reveal {RNA} abundance with high quantitative accuracy, sensitivity and throughput1. However, this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time, posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Here we show that {RNA} velocity-the time derivative of the gene expression state-can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced {mRNAs} in common single-cell {RNA} sequencing protocols. {RNA} velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect {RNA} velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.},

Analyses of differentially expressed genes identified transcriptional signatures of two cell types and provide insights into the current classification of these cells.

Although cell lines are known to evolve in culture, the extent of the resultant genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity and its functional consequences remain understudied. Here we use genomic analyses of 106 human cell lines grown in two laboratories to show extensive clonal diversity. Further comprehensive genomic characterization of 27 strains of the common breast cancer cell line {MCF}7 uncovered rapid genetic diversification. Similar results were obtained with multiple strains of 13 additional cell lines. Notably, genetic changes were associated with differential activation of gene expression programs and marked differences in cell morphology and proliferation. Barcoding experiments showed that cell line evolution occurs as a result of positive clonal selection that is highly sensitive to culture conditions. Analyses of single-cell-derived clones demonstrated that continuous instability quickly translates into heterogeneity of the cell line. When the 27 {MCF}7 strains were tested against 321 anti-cancer compounds, we uncovered considerably different drug responses: at least 75\% of compounds that strongly inhibited some strains were completely inactive in others. This study documents the extent, origins and consequences of genetic variation within cell lines, and provides a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research.},

	abstract = {Objective: The peak-to-peak amplitude of the p13-n23 wave in cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential can increase after furosemide administration in patients with Meniere's disease [furosemide-loading {VEMP} ({FVEMP}) testing]. The examination is used to test for the presence of endolymphatic hydrops; we investigated factors that may influence the results. Methods: Forty-two subjects (23 males and 19 females, aged 24-70 years) with unilateral definite Meniere's disease who underwent {FVEMP} testing were retrospectively studied. Possible factors associated with the results of {FVEMP} testing were studied using logistic regression analysis. Results: Ages, sex, affected side, stage, disease duration, and mean hearing level of pure tone audiometry did not influence the results of {FVEMP} testing in the univariate analysis (p {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.05). Number of days since the last vertigo attack [odds ratio ({OR}): 1.07, p = 0.031] and frequency of vertigo attacks per month ({OR}: 0.42, p = 0.003) were significantly associated with the results of testing. Multivariate analysis showed that both days since the last vertigo attack {\textbackslash}textless 7 ({OR}: 0.13, p = 0.04) and frequency of vertigo attacks per month ≥ 2 ({OR}: 0.06, p = 0.004) were risk factors for negative results on {FVEMP} testing. Conclusion: This study found that recent and frequent vertigo attacks produced negative findings on {FVEMP} testing in Meniere's disease. This apparently irrational finding can be explained by the consequences of membranous labyrinth rupture during vertigo attacks, where the altered saccular resonance due to {EH} cannot be recovered by furosemide administration because of the dissolving dehydration effect that occurs through communication between the endolymphatic and perilymphatic spaces. In addition, the impairment of sensory cells that is caused by endolymph and perilymph mixing upon rupture does not improve upon furosemide administration. {FVEMP} testing results may provide us with pathophysiological information regarding the membranous labyrinth.},

It is a commonly held hypothesis that unique functional sequences would have emerged from a diverse soup of proto-peptides, yet there is a lack of experimental data in support of this. Whereas the majority of studies in the field focus on peptides containing only one or two types of amino acids, here we used modern mass spectrometry ({MS})-based techniques to separate and sequence de novo proto-peptides containing broader combinations of prebiotically plausible monomers. Using a dry-wet environmental cycling protocol, hundreds of proto-peptide sequences were formed over a mere 4 d of reaction. Sequence homology diagrams were constructed to compare experimental and theoretical sequence spaces of tetrameric proto-peptides. {MS}-based analyses such as this will be increasingly necessary as origins-of-life researchers move toward systems-level investigations of prebiotic chemistry.},

Defining the structural basis by which these proteins are anchored to membranes has been hampered by the paucity of unambiguously identified {MIPs} and a lack of computational tools that accurately distinguish monolayer-integrating motifs from bilayer-spanning transmembrane domains ({TMDs}). We used quantitative proteomics and statistical modeling to identify 87 high-confidence candidate {MIPs} in lipid droplets, including 21 proteins with predicted {TMDs} that cannot be accommodated in these monolayer-enveloped organelles. Systematic cysteine-scanning mutagenesis showed the predicted {TMD} of one candidate {MIP}, {DHRS}3, to be a partially buried amphipathic {\textbackslash}alpha-helix in both lipid droplet monolayers and the cytoplasmic leaflet of endoplasmic reticulum membrane bilayers. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations support these observations, suggesting that this helix is most stable at the solvent-membrane interface. The simulations also predicted similar interfacial amphipathic helices when applied to seven additional {MIPs} from our dataset. Our findings suggest that interfacial helices may be a common motif by which {MIPs} are integrated into membranes, and provide high-throughput methods to identify and study {MIPs}.},

Attempts to restore tissue function after damage require knowledge of how physiological tasks are distributed among cell types, and how cell states vary between homeostasis, injury-repair and disease. In the conducting airway, a heterogeneous basal cell population gives rise to specialized luminal cells that perform mucociliary clearance1. Here we perform single-cell profiling of human bronchial epithelial cells and mouse tracheal epithelial cells to obtain a comprehensive census of cell types in the conducting airway and their behaviour in homeostasis and regeneration. Our analysis reveals cell states that represent known and novel cell populations, delineates their heterogeneity and identifies distinct differentiation trajectories during homeostasis and tissue repair. Finally, we identified a novel, rare cell type that we call the 'pulmonary ionocyte', which co-expresses {FOXI}1, multiple subunits of the vacuolar-type H+-{ATPase} (V-{ATPase}) and {CFTR}, the gene that is mutated in cystic fibrosis. Using immunofluorescence, modulation of signalling pathways and electrophysiology, we show that Notch signalling is necessary and {FOXI}1 expression is sufficient to drive the production of the pulmonary ionocyte, and that the pulmonary ionocyte is a major source of {CFTR} activity in the conducting airway epithelium.},

	abstract = {Class-switch recombination ({CSR}) is an essential B cell process that alters the isotype of antibody produced by the B cell, tailoring the immune response to the nature of the invading pathogen. {CSR} requires the activity of the mutagenic enzyme {AID} (encoded by {AICDA}) to generate chromosomal lesions within the immunoglobulin genes that initiate the class switching recombination event. These {AID}-mediated mutations also participate in somatic-hypermutation of the immunoglobulin variable region, driving affinity maturation. As such, {AID} poses a significant oncogenic threat if it functions outside of the immunoglobulin locus. We found that expression of the {microRNA}, {miR}-29b, was repressed in B cells isolated from tonsil tissue, relative to circulating naïve B cells. Further investigation revealed that {miR}-29b was able to directly initiate the degradation of {AID} {mRNA}. Enforced overexpression of {miR}-29b in human B cells precipitated a reduction in overall {AID} protein and a corresponding diminution in {CSR} to {IgE}. Given {miR}-29b's ability to potently target {AID}, a mutagenic molecule that can initiate chromosomal translocations and "off-target" mutations, we propose that {miR}-29b acts to silence premature {AID} expression in naïve B cells, thus reducing the likelihood of inappropriate and potentially dangerous deamination activity.

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase ({AID}) is the key mutagenic enzyme that initiates both these antibody diversification processes by deaminating cytosine to uracil. Here we asked the question if transcription factors can mediate the specific targeting of the antibody diversification by recruiting {AID}. We have recently reported that {AID} is together with the transcription factors E2A, {PAX}5 and {IRF}4 in a complex on key sequences of the Igh locus. Here we report that also {ETS}1 is together with {AID} in this complex on key sequences of the Igh locus in splenic B cells of mice. Furthermore, we show that both {ETS}1 and {PAX}5 can directly recruit {AID} to {DNA} sequences from the Igh locus with the specific binding site for the transcription factor. Taken together, our findings support the notion of a targeting mechanism for the selective diversification of antibody genes with limited genome wide mutagenesis by recruitment of {AID} by {PAX}5 and {ETS}1 in a transcription factor complex. {\textbackslash}copyright 2018 {WILEY}-{VCH} Verlag {GmbH} \& Co. {KGaA}, Weinheim.},

Here, we describe a method termed directed evolution of reprogramming factors by cell selection and sequencing ({DERBY}-seq) to identify artificially enhanced and evolved reprogramming transcription factors. {DERBY}-seq entails pooled screens with libraries of positionally randomised genes, cell selection based on phenotypic readouts, and genotyping by amplicon sequencing for candidate identification. We benchmark this approach using pluripotency reprogramming with libraries based on the reprogramming factor {SOX}2 and the reprogramming incompetent endodermal factor {SOX}17. We identified several {SOX}2 variants outperforming the wild-type protein in three- and four-factor cocktails. The most effective variants were discovered from the {SOX}17 library, demonstrating that this factor can be converted into a highly potent inducer of pluripotency with a range of diverse modifications. We propose {DERBY}-seq as a broad-based approach to discover reprogramming factors for any donor/target cell combination applicable to direct lineage reprogramming in vitro and in vivo.

In a {SWATH}-{MS} measurement, all ionized peptides of a given sample that fall within a specified mass range are fragmented in a systematic and unbiased fashion using rather large precursor isolation windows. To analyse {SWATH}-{MS} data, a strategy based on peptide-centric scoring has been established, which typically requires prior knowledge about the chromatographic and mass spectrometric behaviour of peptides of interest in the form of spectral libraries and peptide query parameters. This tutorial provides guidelines on how to set up and plan a {SWATH}-{MS} experiment, how to perform the mass spectrometric measurement and how to analyse {SWATH}-{MS} data using peptide-centric scoring.

	abstract = {{IgE} antibodies provide defense against helminth infections, but can also cause life-threatening allergic reactions. Despite their importance to human health, these antibodies and the cells that produce them remain enigmatic due to their scarcity in humans; much of our knowledge of their properties is derived from model organisms. Here we describe the isolation of {IgE} producing B cells from the blood of individuals with food allergies, followed by a detailed study of their properties by single cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq). We discovered that {IgE} B cells are deficient in membrane immunoglobulin expression and that the {IgE} plasmablast state is more immature than that of other antibody producing cells. Through recombinant expression of monoclonal antibodies derived from single cells, we identified {IgE} antibodies which had unexpected cross-reactive specificity for major peanut allergens Ara h 2 and Ara h 3; not only are these among the highest affinity native human antibodies discovered to date, they represent a surprising example of convergent evolution in unrelated individuals who independently evolved nearly identical antibodies. Finally, we discovered that splicing within B cells of all isotypes reveals polarized germline transcription of the {IgE}, but not {IgG}4, isotype as well as several examples of biallelic expression of germline transcripts. Our results offer insights into {IgE} B cell transcriptomics, clonality and regulation, provide a striking example of adaptive immune convergence, and offer an approach for accelerating mechanistic disease understanding by characterizing a rare B cell population underlying {IgE}-mediated disease at single cell resolution.},

In ant colonies, the prevalence of local, often chemically mediated, interactions introduces strong links between communication networks and the spatial distribution of ants. It is, however, unknown how ants identify and maintain nest chambers with distinct functions. Here, we combine individual tracking, chemical analysis and machine learning to decipher the chemical signatures present on multiple nest surfaces. We present evidence for several distinct chemical 'road-signs' that guide the ants' movements within the dark nest. These chemical signatures can be used to classify nest chambers with different functional roles. Using behavioural manipulations, we demonstrate that at least three of these chemical signatures are functionally meaningful and allow ants from different task groups to identify their specific nest destinations, thus facilitating colony coordination and stabilization. The use of multiple chemicals that assist spatiotemporal guidance, segregation and pattern formation is abundant in multi-cellular organisms. Here, we provide a rare example for the use of these principles in the ant colony.},

	abstract = {T follicular helper (Tfh) and regulatory (Tfr) cells are terminally differentiated cells found in germinal centers ({GCs}), specialized secondary lymphoid organ structures dedicated to antibody production. As such, follicular T (Tfol) cells are supposed to be specific for immunizing antigens, which has been reported for Tfh cells but is debated for Tfr cells. Here, we used high-throughput T cell receptor ({TCR}) sequencing to analyze the repertoires of Tfh and Tfr cells, at homeostasis and after immunization with self- or foreign antigens. We observed that, whatever the conditions, Tfh and Tfr cell repertoires are less diverse than those of effector T cells and Treg cells of the same tissues; surprisingly, these repertoires still represent thousands of different sequences, even after immunization with a single antigen that induces a 10-fold increase in Tfol cell numbers. Thorough analysis of the sharing and network of {TCR} sequences revealed that a specific response to the immunizing antigen can only, but hardly, be detected in Tfh cells immunized with a foreign antigen and Tfr cells immunized with a self-antigen. These antigen-specific responses are obscured by a global stimulation of Tfh and Tfr cells that appears to be antigen-independent. Altogether, our results suggest a major bystander Tfol cell activation during the immune response in the {GCs}.},

Applying an integrated systems biology approach, we performed 24-hr metabolomics profiling of eight mouse tissues simultaneously. We present a temporal and spatial atlas of circadian metabolism in the context of systemic energy balance and under chronic nutrient stress (high-fat diet [{HFD}]). Comparative analysis reveals how the repertoires of tissue metabolism are linked and gated to specific temporal windows and how this highly specialized communication and coherence among tissue clocks is rewired by nutrient challenge. Overall, we illustrate how dynamic metabolic relationships can be reconstructed across time and space and how integration of circadian metabolomics data from multiple tissues can improve our understanding of health and disease.

This process depends on, and is orchestrated by, activation-induced deaminase ({AID}), a {DNA} cytidine deaminase that acts on single-stranded {DNA} exposed during transcription of switch (S) region sequences at the {IgH} locus. {DNA} lesions thus generated are processed by components of several general {DNA} repair pathways to drive {CSR}. Given that {AID} can instigate {DNA} lesions and genomic instability, stringent checks are imposed that constrain and restrict its mutagenic potential. In this review, we will discuss how {AID} expression and substrate specificity and activity is rigorously enforced at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, post-translational, and epigenetic levels, and how the {DNA}-damage response is choreographed with precision to permit targeted activity while limiting bystander catastrophe.},

Through the exploitation of host {microRNAs}, we recreated an {RNAi}-like environment in vertebrates and directly compared the capacity of positive- and negative-stranded {RNA} viruses to cope with this selective pressure. Applying this defense against four distinct viral families revealed that the capacity to undergo homologous recombination was the defining attribute that enabled evasion of this defense. Independent of gene expression strategy, positive-stranded {RNA} viruses that could undergo strand switching rapidly excised genomic material, while negative-stranded viruses were effectively targeted and cleared upon {RNAi}-based selection.

	abstract = {Problem-solving strategies in immunology currently utilize a series of ad hoc, qualitative variations on a foundation of Burnet's formulation of clonal selection theory. These modifications, including versions of two-signal theory, describe how signals regulate lymphocytes to make important decisions governing self-tolerance and changes to their effector and memory states. These theories are useful but are proving inadequate to explain the observable genesis and control of heterogeneity in cell types, the nonlinear passage of cell fate trajectories and how the input from multiple environmental signals can be integrated at different times and strengths. Here, I argue for a paradigm change to place immune theory on a firmer philosophical and quantitative foundation to resolve these difficulties. This change rejects the notion of identical cell subsets and substitutes the concept of a cell as comprised of autonomous functional mechanical components subject to stochastic variations in construction and operation. The theory aims to explain immunity in terms of cell population dynamics, dictated by the operation of cell machinery, such as randomizing elements, division counters, and fate timers. The effect of communicating signals alone and in combination within this system is determined with a cellular calculus. A series of models developed with these principles can resolve logical cell fate and signaling paradoxes and offer a reinterpretation for how self-non-self discrimination and immune response class are controlled. {\textbackslash}copyright 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Class switch recombination ({CSR}) is a {DNA} recombination reaction that diversifies the effector component of antibody responses. {CSR} is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase ({AID}), which targets transcriptionally active immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) switch donor and acceptor {DNA}. The 3' Igh super-enhancer, 3' regulatory region (3'{RR}), is essential for acceptor region transcription, but how this function is regulated is unknown. Here, we identify the chromatin reader {ZMYND}8 as an essential regulator of the 3'{RR}. In B cells, {ZMYND}8 binds promoters and super-enhancers, including the Igh enhancers. {ZMYND}8 controls the 3'{RR} activity by modulating the enhancer transcriptional status. In its absence, there is increased 3'{RR} polymerase loading and decreased acceptor region transcription and {CSR}. In addition to {CSR}, {ZMYND}8 deficiency impairs somatic hypermutation ({SHM}) of Igh, which is also dependent on the 3'{RR}. Thus, {ZMYND}8 controls Igh diversification in mature B lymphocytes by regulating the activity of the 3' Igh super-enhancer. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {{DNA} methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in gene expression regulation, development, and disease. Recent technological innovations have spurred the development of methods that enable us to study the occurrence and biology of this mark at the single-cell level. Apart from answering fundamental biological questions about heterogeneous systems or rare cell types, low-input methods also bring clinical applications within reach. Ultimately, integrating these data with other single-cell data sets will allow deciphering multiple layers of gene expression regulation within each individual cell. Here, we review the approaches that have been developed to facilitate single-cell {DNA} methylation profiling, their biological applications, and how these will further our understanding of the biology of {DNA} methylation.

We applied this approach to dissect the cell-type- and spatial-domain-associated heterogeneity in the mouse visual cortex region. Our analysis identified distinct spatially associated, cell-type-independent signatures in the glutamatergic and astrocyte cell compartments.

We describe the development, characterization, and proof-of-concept application of a platform for directed evolution of diverse biomolecules of interest ({BOIs}) directly in human cells. The platform relies on a custom-designed adenovirus variant lacking multiple genes, including the essential {DNA} polymerase and protease genes, features that allow us to evolve {BOIs} encoded by genes as large as 7 kb while attaining the mutation rates and enforcing the selection pressure required for successful directed evolution. High mutagenesis rates are continuously attained by trans-complementation of a newly engineered, highly error-prone form of the adenoviral polymerase. Selection pressure that couples desired {BOI} functions to adenoviral propagation is achieved by linking the functionality of the encoded {BOI} to the production of adenoviral protease activity by the human cell. The dynamic range for directed evolution can be enhanced to several orders of magnitude via application of a small-molecule adenoviral protease inhibitor to modulate selection pressure during directed evolution experiments. This platform makes it possible, in principle, to evolve any biomolecule activity that can be coupled to adenoviral protease expression or activation by simply serially passaging adenoviral populations carrying the {BOI}. As proof-of-concept, we use the platform to evolve, directly in the human cell environment, several transcription factor variants that maintain high levels of function while gaining resistance to a small-molecule inhibitor. We anticipate that this platform will substantially expand the repertoire of biomolecules that can be reliably and robustly engineered for both research and therapeutic applications in metazoan systems.},

Breakdown of this barrier can lead to significant morbidity and potentially life-threatening infections for patients. Determining the identity and organization of oral epithelial progenitor cells ({OEPCs}) is therefore paramount to understanding their roles in homeostasis and disease. Using lineage tracing and label retention experiments, we show that rapidly dividing {OEPCs} are located broadly within the basal layer of the mucosa throughout the oral cavity. Quantitative clonal analysis demonstrated that {OEPCs} undergo population-asymmetrical divisions following neutral drift dynamics and that they respond to chemotherapy-induced damage by altering daughter cell fates. Finally, using single-cell {RNA}-seq, we establish the basal layer population structure and propose a model that defines the organization of cells within the basal layer.

Knockdown of {NME}2 leads to decreased {CSR}, while knockdown of the highly homologous {NME}1 results in increased {CSR}. Interestingly, these {NME} proteins also display differential occupancy at S regions during {CSR} despite their homology; {NME}1 binds to S regions prior to stimulation, while {NME}2 binds to S regions only after stimulation.

Single-cell technologies are useful for deconstructing the considerable heterogeneity that emerges during lineage conversion. However, lineage relationships are typically lost during cell processing, complicating trajectory reconstruction. Here we present '{CellTagging}', a combinatorial cell-indexing methodology that enables parallel capture of clonal history and cell identity, in which sequential rounds of cell labelling enable the construction of multi-level lineage trees. {CellTagging} and longitudinal tracking of fibroblast to induced endoderm progenitor reprogramming reveals two distinct trajectories: one leading to successfully reprogrammed cells, and one leading to a 'dead-end' state, paths determined in the earliest stages of lineage conversion. We find that expression of a putative methyltransferase, Mettl7a1, is associated with the successful reprogramming trajectory; adding Mettl7a1 to the reprogramming cocktail increases the yield of induced endoderm progenitors. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of our lineage-tracing method for revealing the dynamics of direct reprogramming.},

In this work, we show that massively parallel {DNA} sequencing of rearranged immune receptor loci can provide direct detection and tracking of immune diversity and expanded clonal lymphocyte populations in physiological and pathological contexts. {DNA} was isolated from blood and tissue samples, a series of redundant primers was used to amplify diverse {DNA} rearrangements, and the resulting mixtures of barcoded amplicons were sequenced using long-read ultra deep sequencing. Individual {DNA} molecules were then characterized on the basis of {DNA} segments that had been joined to make a functional (or nonfunctional) immune effector. Current experimental designs can accommodate up to 150 samples in a single sequence run, with the depth of sequencing sufficient to identify stable and dynamic aspects of the immune repertoire in both normal and diseased circumstances. These data provide a high-resolution picture of immune spectra in normal individuals and in patients with hematological malignancies, illuminating, in the latter case, both the initial behavior of clonal tumor populations and the later suppression or re-emergence of such populations after treatment.},

Although effective genetic labeling approaches are available in model systems, in humans, most approaches require detection of nuclear somatic mutations, which have high error rates, limited scale, and do not capture cell state information. Here, we show that somatic mutations in {mtDNA} can be tracked by single-cell {RNA} or assay for transposase accessible chromatin ({ATAC}) sequencing. We leverage somatic {mtDNA} mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their utility as highly accurate clonal markers to infer cellular relationships. We track native human cells both in vitro and in vivo and relate clonal dynamics to gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow clonal tracking at a 1,000-fold greater scale than with nuclear genome sequencing, with simultaneous information on cell state, opening the way to chart cellular dynamics in human health and disease.},

However, for many of these populations it is unclear whether they develop from common or separate progenitors. To address such issues, we developed a novel approach, termed cellular barcoding, that allows the dissection of lineage relationships. We demonstrate that the labeling of cells with unique identifiers coupled to a microarray-based detection system can be used to analyze family relationships between the progeny of such cells. To exemplify the potential of this technique, we studied migration patterns of families of antigen-specific {CD}8+ T cells in vivo. We demonstrate that progeny of individual T cells rapidly seed independent lymph nodes and that antigen-specific {CD}8+ T cells present at different effector sites are largely derived from a common pool of precursors. These data show how locally primed T cells disperse and provide a technology for kinship analysis with wider utility.},

Analysis of sister cells also revealed cells to have intrinsic fate biases not detectable by single-cell {RNA} sequencing. Finally, we benchmarked computational methods of dynamic inference from single-cell snapshots, showing that fate choice occurs earlier than is detected by state-of the-art algorithms and that cells progress steadily through pseudotime with precise and consistent dynamics.},

Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells.

We show that {CD}40 is obligatory in vivo, as {CD}40 knockout mice exhibit no Ag-driven mutation. In contrast, {CD}38 is not, as {CD}38 knockout mice mutate normally. We believe that, in vitro, {CD}38, in combination with other stimuli, drives extensive cell division, allowing the detection of mutated sequences. However, in germinal centers in vivo, proliferative activity is instigated by a different molecule.

Accordingly, memory B cells exhibited enhanced survival, proliferation, and Ig secretion, and they entered division more rapidly than did naive B cells in response to both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent stimuli. Furthermore, both {IgM} and isotype-switched memory B cells, but not naive B cells, costimulated {CD}4+ T cells in vitro through a mechanism dependent on their constitutive expression of {CD}80 and {CD}86.

Most are antigen-experienced memory B cells that arise during responses to microbial infections and are key to pathogen clearance and control. Their increasing prevalence with age contributes to several well-established features of immunosenescence, including reduced B cell genesis and damped immune responses. In addition, they are elevated in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, and in these settings they are enriched for characteristic autoantibody specificities. Together, these features identify age-associated B cells as a subset with pivotal roles in immunological health, disease, and aging. Accordingly, a detailed understanding of their origins, functions, and physiology should make them tractable translational targets in each of these settings.},

	abstract = {The galectin {LGALS}1 is a glycan binding protein that regulates intracellular (e.g. signal transduction) and extracellular processes (e.g. immunity, leukocyte mobilization) that support cell survival. The protein is best known for its role in {RAS} signaling. {LGALS}1 is important in acute lymphoblastic leukemia but its role in acute myeloid leukemia is not well defined. We previously found suppression of {LGALS}1 in {AML} cell lines {OCI}-{AML}3 and {THP}-1 sensitized both cell lines to {BCL}2 inhibitor {ABT}-737. In this study, we used an in vivo murine {OCI}-{AML}3 xenograft model to test whether reduction expression of {LGALS}1 affects survival. Mice bearing the {OCI}-{AML}3 cells with {LGALS}1 {shRNA} survived significantly longer than mice with control {OCI}-{AML}3 cells. Gene expression profiling using {RNASeq} was performed using the control and {LGALS}1 {shRNA} of p53 {WT} {OCI}-{AML}3 and p53 mutant {THP}-1 cells. The data reveal distinct differences between the two cell lines in number of genes affected, in pathways associated with these genes, in expression of oncogenes, and in the transcription factors involved. The p53 pathway is prominent in {OCI}-{AML}3 cells. An examination of {LGALS}1 {mRNA} in an {AML} patient population reveals elevated {LGALS}1 {mRNA} is associated with shorter disease free survival and increased blasts in the {BM}. This data with the xenograft model data presented suggest {LGALS}1 may be important in the {AML} microenvironment. In summary, the data presented here suggest that a strategy targeting {LGALS}1 may benefit {AML} patients.},

Understanding the heritability and asymmetry of phenotypic changes throughout this process requires determination of clonal-level contributions to fate selection. Evaluating intraclonal and interclonal heterogeneity and the influence of distinct fate determinants in large numbers of cell lineages, however, is usually laborious, requiring familial tracing and fate mapping. In this study, we introduce a novel, accessible, high-throughput method for measuring familial fate changes with accompanying statistical tools for testing hypotheses. The method combines multiplexing of division tracking dyes with detection of phenotypic markers to reveal clonal lineage properties. We illustrate the method by studying in vitro-activated mouse {CD}8+ T cell cultures, reporting division and phenotypic changes at the level of families. This approach has broad utility as it is flexible and adaptable to many cell types and to modifications of in vitro, and potentially in vivo, fate monitoring systems.},

	abstract = {Single-cell molecular tools have been developed at an incredible pace over the last five years as sequencing costs continue to drop and numerous molecular assays have been coupled to sequencing readouts. This rapid period of technological development has facilitated the delineation of individual molecular characteristics including the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome of individual cells, leading to an unprecedented resolution of the molecular networks governing complex biological systems. The immense power of single-cell molecular screens has been particularly highlighted through work in systems where cellular heterogeneity is a key feature, such as stem cell biology, immunology, and tumor cell biology. Single-cell-omics technologies have already contributed to the identification of novel disease biomarkers, cellular subsets, therapeutic targets and diagnostics, many of which would have been undetectable by bulk sequencing approaches. More recently, efforts to integrate single-cell multi-omics with single cell functional output and/or physical location have been challenging but have led to substantial advances. Perhaps most excitingly, there are emerging opportunities to reach beyond the description of static cellular states with recent advances in modulation of cells through {CRISPR} technology, in particular with the development of base editors which greatly raises the prospect of cell and gene therapies. In this review, we provide a brief overview of emerging single-cell technologies and discuss current developments in integrating single-cell molecular screens and performing single-cell multi-omics for clinical applications. We also discuss how single-cell molecular assays can be usefully combined with functional data to unpick the mechanism of cellular decision-making. Finally, we reflect upon the introduction of spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, its complementary role with single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) and potential application in cellular and gene therapy.},

	abstract = {Over the past 25 years, the importance of hematopoietic stem cell ({HSC}) aging in overall hematopoietic and immune system health span has been appreciated. Much work has been done in model organisms to understand the intrinsic dysregulation that occurs in {HSCs} during aging, with the goal of identifying modifiable mechanisms that represent the proverbial “fountain of youth.” Much more recently, the discovery of somatic mutations that are found to provide a selective advantage to {HSCs} and accumulate in the hematopoietic system during aging, termed clonal hematopoiesis ({CH}), inspires revisiting many of these previously defined drivers of {HSC} aging in the context of these somatic mutations. To truly understand these processes and develop a holistic picture of {HSC} aging, ongoing and future studies must include investigation of the critical changes that occur in the {HSC} niche or bone marrow microenvironment with aging, as increasing evidence supports that these {HSC}-extrinsic alterations provide necessary inflammation, signaling pathway activation or repression, and other selective pressures to favor {HSC} aging-associated phenotypes and {CH}. Here, we provide our perspectives based on the past 8 years of our own laboratory's investigations into these mechanisms and chart a path for integrative studies that, in our opinion, will provide an ideal opportunity to discover {HSC} and hematopoietic health span-extending interventions. This path includes examining when and how aging-associated {HSC}-intrinsic and {HSC}-extrinsic changes accumulate over time in different individuals and developing new models to track and test relevant {HSC}-extrinsic changes, complementary to innovative {HSC} lineage tracing systems that have recently been developed.},

Here we perform {TCRB} sequencing, integration site analysis, and single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) to profile {CD}8+ {CAR}-T cells from infusion products ({IPs}) and blood of patients undergoing {CD}19 {CAR}-T immunotherapy. {TCRB} sequencing shows that clonal diversity of {CAR}-T cells is highest in the {IPs} and declines following infusion. We observe clones that display distinct patterns of clonal kinetics, making variable contributions to the {CAR}-T cell pool after infusion. Although integration site does not appear to be a key driver of clonal kinetics, {scRNA}-seq demonstrates that clones that expand after infusion mainly originate from infused clusters with higher expression of cytotoxicity and proliferation genes. Thus, we uncover transcriptional programs associated with {CAR}-T cell behavior after infusion.},

Alternatively, diversity might result from differing {CD}1 isoforms, antigens and methods used to identify {TCRs}. Using {CD}1b tetramers to isolate clones recognizing the same glycolipid, we identified a previously unknown pattern of variable (V) gene usage ({TRAV}17, {TRBV}4-1) among unrelated human subjects. These {TCRs} are distinct from those present on {NKT} cells and germline-encoded mycolyl lipid reactive ({GEM}) T cells.

Interdonor {TCR} conservation was observed in vitro and ex vivo, identifying {LDN}5-like T cells as a distinct T cell type.

Clinical studies indicate that antigen-specific antibody responses can be maintained for many years, leading to theories that reactivation/differentiation of memory B cells into plasma cells is required to sustain long-term antibody production. Here, we present a decade-long study in which we demonstrate site-specific survival of bone marrow-derived plasma cells and durable antibody responses to multiple virus and vaccine antigens in rhesus macaques for years after sustained memory B cell depletion. Moreover, {BrdU}+ cells with plasma cell morphology can be detected for 10 years after vaccination/{BrdU} administration, indicating that plasma cells may persist for a prolonged period of time in the absence of cell division. On the basis of these results, long-lived plasma cells represent a key cell population responsible for long-term antibody production and serological memory.},

Here, we use light sheet microscopy of T cells in the larval zebrafish as a model system to study motility across large populations of cells over hours in their native context. We show that cells do not perform Levy flight; rather, there is substantial cell-to-cell variability in speed, which persists over timespans of a few hours. This variability is amplified by a correlation between speed and directional persistence, generating a characteristic cell behavioral manifold that is preserved under a perturbation to cell speeds, and seen in Mouse T cells and \textit{Dictyostelium}. Together, these effects generate a broad range of length scales over which cells explore in vivo.},

	abstract = {Summary Despite the extreme diversity of T-cell repertoires, many identical T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences are found in a large number of individual mice and humans. These widely shared sequences, often referred to as ``public,'' have been suggested to be over-represented due to their potential immune functionality or their ease of generation by V(D)J recombination. Here, we show that even for large cohorts, the observed degree of sharing of TCR sequences between individuals is well predicted by a model accounting for the known quantitative statistical biases in the generation process, together with a simple model of thymic selection. Whether a sequence is shared by many individuals is predicted to depend on the number of queried individuals and the sampling depth, as well as on the sequence itself, in agreement with the data. We introduce the degree of publicness conditional on the queried cohort size and the size of the sampled repertoires. Based on these observations, we propose a public/private sequence classifier, ``PUBLIC'' (Public Universal Binary Likelihood Inference Classifier), based on the generation probability, which performs very well even for small cohort sizes.},
