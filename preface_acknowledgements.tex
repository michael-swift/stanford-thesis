I am grateful to my advisor, Steve Quake, for his steadfast belief in his students and kind guidance.
Steve contributed to work presented here as well as my growth as a scientist. The environment he has helped create in his lab is fun, hard-working, and rewarding. What I admire most about Steve is his broad interests and incisive lines of questioning.

I thank my committee members, Dan Jarosz, Daria Mochly-Rosen, and Bali Pulendran for their helpful guidance and questions.
I thank Felix Horns, his contribution to my development as a graduate student cannot be overstated. From him, I learned about single-cell sequencing and the molecular biology underpinning these technologies, as well as bioinformatics. From him, I learned how to think critically about data and carefully read the scientific literature. He was very patient with me as I learned the ropes. He is a fantastic collaborator, mentor and friend.  I thank Bob Jones and Sheela Crasta for helping me coordinate sample collections for the Tabula Bursa work. I thank the anonymous organ donors who made the work possible. 
I thank Norma Neff, Rose Yan, and Angela Detweiler for helping generate most of the sequencing data presented here. I thank Ivana Cvijovic for being a fantastic collaborator and friend. I thank all the members of the Quake group. Academic labs experience a large amount of turnover, yet while people left, the soul of the lab has remained curious and courageous towards science. Working with them has been really fun. I would especially like to thank Mira Moufarrej with whom I shared a bay. She made coming to work fun, and was incredibly helpful with computational and experimental issues I had. 
I thank Whitney Combes, Vickie Lin, and Sheela Crasta for keeping the lab running smoothly.
My work was supported by an NIH training grant and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Importantly, I thank my friends and family for the support throughout graduate school. In particular, I acknowledge my Mom and Dad, who are the most supportive people I've ever known. I love them lots.
